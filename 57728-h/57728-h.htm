<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Arthur</span> kept his word, and tried manfully
not to let his own disappointment
interfere with the enjoyment of Christmas
Day. The party at the vicarage was
smaller than usual, for Rob and Oswald
had both gone home for the festive
season, and he knew well that the
knowledge that “Arthur was coming”
had seemed the best guarantee of a
merry day to those who were left behind.
Peggy too—poor little Peg, with her
bandaged hands and tiny white face—it
would never do to grieve her by being
depressed and gloomy!</p>

<p>“Begone, dull care!” cried Arthur to
himself then, when he awoke on Christmas
morning, and promptly wrapping
himself in his dressing-gown, he sallied
out on to the landing, where he burst
into the strains of “Christians, awake!”
with such vigorous brush-and-comb
accompaniment on the panels of the
doors as startled the household out of
their dreams.</p>

<p>“Miserable boy! I was having such
a lovely nap! I’ll never forgive you!”
cried Mrs. Asplin’s voice in sleepy
wrath.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!”
shouted the girls, and Peggy’s
clear pipe joined in last of all. “And
many of them! Come in! Come in! I
was lying awake and longing to see
you!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">{434}</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur put his ruffled head round the
door and beamed at the little figure in
the bed, as if he had never known a
trouble in his life.</p>

<p>“What a wicked story! I heard you
snore. Merry Christmas, Peg, and a
Happy New Year! And don’t you go
for to do it again never no more! It’s
a jolly morning. I’ll take you out for a
toddle in the garden when we come
home from church, if you are a good
girl. Will you have your present now,
or wait till you get it? It begins with a
B. I love my love with a B., because
she’s a——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur!” interrupted Peggy
regretfully. “I haven’t half such a
nice present for you as I expected.
You see I couldn’t work anything, and
I couldn’t get out to the shops, and I
hadn’t nearly as much money as I
expected either. If Bob and I had
won that prize, I should have had ten
pounds; but the stupid editors have put
off announcing the result week after
week. They say there were so many
competitors; but that’s no consolation,
for it makes our chance less. I do hope
it may be out next week. But, at any
rate, I didn’t get my ten pounds in time,
and there I was, you see, with little
money and practically no hands, a—er—a
most painful contingency, which I
hope it may never be your lot to experience.
You must take the will for
the deed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will!” agreed Arthur promptly.
“I’ll take the will now, and you can
follow up with the deed as soon as you
get the cash. But no more journeys up
to London, my dear, if you love me, and
don’t use such big words before seven
o’clock in the morning, or you’ll choke.
It’s bad for little girls to exert themselves
so much. Now I’m going to
skate about in the bath for a bit, and
tumble into my clothes, and then I’ll
come back and give you a lift downstairs.
You are coming down for breakfast, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Rather! On Christmas morning!
I should just think I was!” cried Peggy
emphatically, and Arthur went off to
the bath-room, calling in at Max’s room
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to squeeze a sponge full of
water over that young gentleman’s head
and pull the clothes off the bed by way
of giving emphasis to his “Get up,
you lazy beggar! It’s the day after
to-morrow, and the plum pudding is
waiting!”</p>

<p>Peggy was the only one of the young
folks who did not go to church that
morning; but she was left in charge of
the decoration for the dinner-table, and
when this was finished, there was so
much to think about that the time
passed all too quickly.</p>

<p>Last year she and Arthur had spent
Christmas with their mother; now both
parents were away in India, and everything
was strange and altered. As
Peggy sat gazing into the heart of the
big gloomy fire, it seemed to her that
the year that was passing away would
end a complete epoch in her brother’s
experiences and her own, and that from
this hour a new chapter would begin.
She herself had come back from the
door of death, and had life given, as it
were, afresh into her hands. Arthur’s
longed-for career had been checked at
its commencement, and all his plans
laid waste. Even the life in the vicarage
would henceforth take new conditions,
for Rob and Oswald would go up to
Oxford at the beginning of the term,
and their place be filled by new pupils.
There was something solemnising in
the consciousness of change which filled
the air. One could never tell what
might be the next development. Nothing
was too unexpected to happen—since
Arthur’s success had ended in failure,
and she herself had received Rosalind’s
vows of love and friendship.</p>

<p>“Good things have happened as well
as bad,” acknowledged Peggy honestly,
“but how I do hate changes! The new
pupils may be the nicest boys that were
ever born, but no one will ever be like
Rob to me, and I’d rather Arthur had
been a soldier than anything in the
wide world. I wish one could go on
being young for ever and ever. It’s
when you grow old that all these
troubles and changes come upon you.”
And Peggy sighed and wagged her
head, oppressed with the weight of
fifteen years.</p>

<p>It was a relief to hear the clatter of
horses’ hoofs, and the sound of voices
in the hall, which proved that the
church-goers had returned home. Mr.
and Mrs. Asplin had been driven home
from church by Lord and Lady Darcy,
and the next moment they were in the
room, greeting Peggy with demonstrative
affection.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t go home without coming
to see you, dear,” said Lady Darcy
fondly. “Rosalind is walking with the
rest, and will be here in a few minutes.
A merry Christmas to you, darling, and
many, many of them. I’ve brought you
a little present which I hope you will
like. It’s a bangle bracelet—quite a
simple one that you can wear every day—and
you must think of me sometimes
when you put it on.”</p>

<p>She touched the spring of a morocco
case as she spoke, and there on the satin
lining lay a band of gold, dependent
from which hung the sweetest little locket
in the world—heart-shaped, studded with
pearls, and guarding a ring of hair
beneath the glass shield.</p>

<p>Lady Darcy pointed to it in silence—her
eyes filling with tears, as they
invariably did at any reference to
Rosalind’s accident, and Peggy’s cheeks
flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“I can’t thank you! I really can’t,”
she said. “It is too lovely. You
couldn’t possibly have given me anything
I liked better. I have a predilection
for jewellery, and the little locket
is <em>too</em> sweet, dangling on that chain!
I do love to have something that
waggles!” She held up her arm as
she spoke, shaking the locket to and fro
with a childlike enjoyment, while the two
ladies watched her with tender amusement.
Lord Darcy had not spoken since
his first greeting, but now he came
forward, and linking his arm in Peggy’s
led her to the further end of the room.</p>

<p>“I have no present for you, my dear—I
could not think of one that was
good enough—but yesterday I really
think I hit on something that would
please you. Robert told us how keenly
you were feeling your brother’s disappointment,
and that he was undecided
what to try next. Now, I believe I can
help him there. I have influence in the
Foreign Office, and can insure him an
opening when he is ready for it, if
your father agrees that it is desirable.
Would that please you, Peggy? If I
can help your brother, will it go some
little way towards paying the debt I owe
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh—h!” cried Peggy rapturously.
“Oh!” She clasped Lord Darcy’s
hands in her own and gazed at him with
dilated eyes. “Can you do it? Will
you do it? There is nothing in all the
world I should like so much. Help
Arthur—give him a good chance—and I
shall bless you for ever and ever! I
could never thank you enough——”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I will write to your father
and see what he has to say. I can
promise the lad a start at least, and
after that his future will be in his own
hands, where I think we may safely
leave it. Master Arthur is one of the
fortunate beings who has an ‘open
sesame’ to all hearts. Mr. Asplin
assures me that he is as good at work
as at play; I have not seen that side of
his character, but he has always left a
most pleasing impression on my mind,
most pleasing.” The old lord smiled
to himself, and his eyes took a dreamy
expression as if he were recalling to
memory the handsome face and strong
manly presence of the young fellow of
whom he was speaking. “He has
been a favourite at our house for some
years now, and I shall be glad to do him
a service, but remember, Peggy, that
when I propose this help, it is in the
first instance at least, for your sake, not
his. I tell you this because I think it
will give you pleasure to feel that you
have been the means of helping your
brother. Talk it over with him some
time when you are alone together, and
then he can come up and see me. To-day
we must leave business alone.
Here they come! I thought they would
not be long after us——”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke voices sounded from
the hall, there was a clatter of feet
over the tiled flooring, and Mellicent
dashed into the room.</p>

<p>“P—P—P—Postman!” she stammered
breathlessly. “He is coming!
Round the corner! Heaps of letters!
Piles of parcels! A hand-cart, and a
boy to help him! Here in five minutes!
Oh! oh! oh!” She went rushing back
to the door, and Rosalind came forward,
looking almost her old beautiful self,
with her cheeks flushed by the cold air,
and the fur collar of her jacket turned
up so as to hide the scarred cheek.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, Rosalind! How—how
nice you look!” cried Peggy,
looking up and down the dainty figure
with more pleasure in the sight than she
could have believed possible a few weeks
before. After being accustomed for
four long weeks to gaze at those perfectly
cut features, Esther’s long chin
and Mellicent’s retroussé nose had
been quite a trial to her artistic sensibilities
on her return to the vicarage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
It was like having a masterpiece taken
down from the walls and replaced by
an inferior engraving. She gave a sigh
of satisfaction as she looked once more
at Rosalind’s face.</p>

<p>“Mewwy Chwistmas, Peggy! I’ve
missed you fwightfully. I’ve not been
to church, but I dwove down to meet the
others, and come to see you. I had to
see you on Chwistmas Day. I’ve had
lovely pwesents and there are more to
come. Mother has given you the
bwacelet, I see. Is it what you like?”</p>

<p>“My dear, I <em>love</em> it! I’m fearfully
addicted to jewellery. I had to put it
on at once, and it looks quite elegant on
top of the bandages! I’m inexpressibly
obliged. I’ve got heaps of things—books,
scent, glove-box, writing-case, a
big box coming from India, and—don’t
tell her—an apron from Mellicent! The
most awful thing. I can’t think where
she found it. Yellow cloth with dog
roses worked in filoselle! Imagine me
in a yellow apron with spotty roses
around the brim!”</p>

<p>“He! He! I can’t! I weally
can’t. It’s too widiculous!” protested
Rosalind. “She sent me a twine bag
made of netted cotton. It’s awfully
useful if you use twine, but I never do.
Don’t say I said so. Who got the
night-dwess bag with the two shades of
blue that didn’t match?”</p>

<p>“Esther! You should have seen her
face!” whispered Peggy roguishly, and
the girls went into peals of laughter
which brought Robert hurrying across
the room to join them.</p>

<p>“Now then, Rosalind; when you have
quite done, I should like to speak to
Peggy. The compliments of the season
to you, Mariquita; I hope I see you
well.”</p>

<p>Peggy pursed up her lips and looked
him up and down with her dancing hazel
eyes.</p>

<p>“Most noble sir, the heavens rain
blessings on you—oh, my goodness,
there’s the postman!” she cried all in
one breath, and the partners darted
forward side by side towards the front
door, where the old postman was already
standing, beaming all over his weatherbeaten
face, as he began turning out
the letters and calling out the names on
the envelopes.</p>

<p>“Asplin, Asplin, Saville, Asplin,
Saville, Saville, Miss Peggy Saville,
Miss Mellercent Asplin, Miss Saville,
Miss M. Saville, Miss Peggy Saville.”</p>

<p>So the list ran on with such a constant
repetition of the same name that Max
exclaimed in disgust, “Who <em>is</em> this
Miss Peggy Saville that we hear so
much about? She’s a greedy thing
whoever she may be,” and Mellicent
whined out, “I wish I had been at a
boarding school! I wish my relatives
lived abroad. There will be none left
for me by the time she has finished.”
Then Arthur thrust forward his mischievous
face and put in a stern
inquiry—</p>

<p>“Forbes! I say, where’s that
registered letter? That letter with the
hundred pound note. Don’t say you
haven’t got it, for I know better. Hand
it over now, without any more bother.”</p>

<p>The old postman gave a chuckle of
amusement, for this was a standing
joke renewed every Christmas that
Arthur had spent at the Vicarage.</p>

<p>“’Tasn’t come ter-day, Muster Saville.
Missed the post. ’Twill be coming
ter-morrer morning certain!”</p>

<p>“Forbes!” croaked Arthur solemnly.
“Reflect! You have a wife and
children. This is a serious business.
It’s ruin, Forbes, that’s what it is.
R—u—i—n, my friend! Be advised by
me, and give it up. The hundred
pounds is not worth it, and besides I
need it badly. Don’t deprive a man of
his inheritance!”</p>

<p>“Bless yer rart, I’d bring it yer with
pleasure rif I could! Nobody’d bring it
quicker ran I would,” cried Forbes, for
like everyone else he adored the handsome
young fellow who was always ready
with a joke and a kindly word. “It’s
comin’ for the Noo Year, sir. You
mark my words. There’s a deal of luck
waitin’ for yer in the Noo Year!”</p>

<p>Arthur’s laugh ended in a sigh, but
he thanked the old man for his good
wishes, tipped him even more lavishly
than usual, and followed his companions
to the drawing-room to examine their
treasures.</p>

<p>Parcels were put on one side to await
more leisurely inspection, but cards and
letters were opened at once, and Rob
seated himself by Peggy’s side as she
placed the pile of envelopes on a table
in the corner.</p>

<p>“We are partners, you know,” he
reminded her, “so I think I am
entitled to a share in these. What a
lot of cards! Who on earth are the
senders?”</p>

<p>“My godfathers, and my godmothers,
and all my relations and friends. The
girls at school, and some of the teachers.
This fat one is from ‘Buns’—Miss
Baker, the one whose Sunday hat I
squashed. She used to say that I was
sent to her as wholesome discipline to
prevent her being too happy as a hard-worked
teacher in a lady’s school, but
she wept buckets full when I came
away. I liked Buns! This is from
Marjorie Riggs, my chum. She had a
squint, but a most engaging disposition.
This is from Kate Strong. Now if there
is a girl in the world for whom I cherish
an aversion, it is Katie Strong! She is
what I call a specious pig, and why she
wanted to send me a Christmas card I
simply can’t imagine. We were on
terms of undying hatred. This is from
Miss Moss, the pupil teacher. She had
chilblains, poor dear, and spoke through
her dose. ‘You busn’t do it, Peggy,
you really busn’t. It’s bost adoying!’
Then I did it again, you know, and she
sniggered and tried to look cross. This
is—I don’t know who this is from! It’s
a man’s writing. It looks like a
business letter—London postmark—and
something printed in white on the seal.
What is it? ‘The Pic-Pic-Piccadilly’—Robert!”
Peggy’s voice grew shrill
with excitement. “‘<cite>The Piccadilly
Magazine.</cite>’”</p>

<p>“Wh—at!” Robert grabbed at the
envelope, read the words himself and
stared at her with sparkling eyes. “It
is! It’s the prize, Mariquita! It must
be. What else would they write about?
Open it and see. Quick! Shall I do it
for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried Peggy breathlessly.
She craned her head forward as Rob
tore open the envelope and grasped his
arm with both hands. Together they
read the typewritten words, together
they gasped and panted, and shrieked
aloud in joy! “We’ve done it! We
have! We’ve won the prize! Thirty
pounds! Bravo Rob! Now you can buy
your microscope!”—“Good old Mariquita,
it’s all your doing. Don’t speak
to us; we are literary people, far above
ordinary commonplace creatures like
you. Thir—ty pounds! made by our
own honest toil. What do you think of
that, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>Each member of the audience thought
something different, and said it amid a
scene of wild excitement. The elders
were pleased and proud, though not
above improving the occasion by warnings
against secret work, over anxiety,
midnight journeys, etc. Mellicent
exclaimed, “How jolly! Now you will
be able to give presents for the New
Year as well as Christmas,” and Arthur
said, “Dear Peggums! I always loved
you! I took the ‘will,’ you know, without
any grumbling, and now you can follow
up with the deed as quickly as ever you
like!” Each one wanted to hold the
precious document in his own hands, to
read it with his own eyes, and it was
handed round and round to be exclaimed
over in accents of wonder and admiration,
while Rob beamed, and Peggy
tossed her pigtail over her shoulder,
holding her little head at an angle of
complacent satisfaction.</p>

<p>The moment of triumph was very
sweet, all the sweeter because of the
sorrows of the last few weeks. The
partners forgot all the hard work,
worry, and exhaustion, and remembered
only the joy of success and hope fulfilled.
Robert said little, in the way of
thanks, preferring to wait until he could
tell Peggy of his gratitude, without an
audience to criticise his words, and
when his mother began to speak of returning
home, it was he who reminded
Mrs. Asplin of the promise that the
invalid should have her first walk on
Christmas Day.</p>

<p>“Let us go on ahead and take her
with us, until the carriage overtakes us.
It will do her no harm. It’s bright and
dry——”</p>

<p>“Oh, mater, yes! I told Peg I would
take her out,” chimed in Arthur, starting
from his seat by Rosalind’s side,
and looking quite distressed because he
had momentarily forgotten his promise.
“Wrap her up well, and we’ll take care
of her. The air will do her good.”</p>

<p>“I think it will, but you must not go
far—not an inch beyond the cross
roads. Come, Peggy, and I’ll dress you
myself. I can’t trust you to put on
enough wraps.” Mrs. Asplin whisked
the girl out of the room, and wrapped
her up to such an extent, that when she
came downstairs again, she could only
puff and gasp above her muffler, declare
that she was choking, and fan herself
with her muff. Choking or not, the
eyes of the companions brightened as
they looked at her, for the scarlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">{436}</a></span>
tam-o’-shanter was set at a rakish angle
on the dark little head, and Peggy the
invalid seemed to have made way for
the Peggy of old, with dimpling cheeks
and the light of mischief in her eyes.</p>

<p>The moment that Mrs. Asplin stopped
fumbling with her wraps, she was at
the door, opening her mouth wide to
drink in the fresh chill air, and Robert
was at her side before anyone had a
chance of superseding him.</p>

<p>“Umph! Isn’t it good! I’m stifling
for a blow. My lungs are sore for want
of exercise. I was longing—longing
to get out. Robert, do you realise it?
We have won the prize! Can you
believe it? It is almost too good to be
true. It’s the best present of all. Now
you can buy your microscope, and get
on with your work as you never could
before!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s all your doing, Mariquita.
I could not have pulled it off
without your help. If I make anything
out of my studies it will be your doing
too. I’ll put it down to you, and thank
you for it all my life.”</p>

<p>“H—m! I don’t think I deserve so
much praise, but I like it all the same.
It’s very soothing,” said Peggy reflectively.
“I’m very happy, and I needed
something to cheer me up, for I felt
as blue as indigo this morning. We
seem to have come to the end of so
many things, and I hate ends. There
is this disappointment about Arthur
which spoils all the old plans, and the
break-up of our good times here together.
I shall miss Oswald. He was
a dear old dandy, and his ties were
quite an excitement in life, but I simply
can’t imagine what the house will be
like without you, Rob!”</p>

<p>“I shall be here for some weeks every
year, and I’ll run down for a day or two
whenever I can. It won’t be good-bye
altogether.”</p>

<p>“I know—I know! but you will never
be one of us again, living in the house,
joining in all our jokes. It will be quite
a different thing. And you will grow up
so quickly at Oxford, and be a man
before we know where we are.”</p>

<p>“So will you—a woman at least. You
are fifteen in January. At seventeen
girls put their hair up, and wear long
dresses. You will look older than I do,
and give yourself as many airs as if you
were fifty. I know what girls of seventeen
are like. I’ve met lots of them,
and they say ‘That boy!’ and toss their
heads as if they were a dozen years
older than fellows of their own age. I
expect you will be as bad as the rest,
but you needn’t try to snub me. I won’t
stand it.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have a chance, for I sha’n’t
be here. As soon as my education is
finished I am going out to India to stay
until father retires and we come home to
settle. So after to-day——”</p>

<p>“After to-day—the deluge! Peggy,
I didn’t tell you before, but I’m off to-morrow
to stay in town until I go up to
Oxford on the fourteenth. The pater
wants to have me with him, so I sha’n’t
see you again for some months. Of
course I am glad to be in town for most
things, but——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but!” repeated Peggy and
turned a wan little face upon him.
“Oh, Rob, it <em>is</em> changing quickly. I
never thought it would be so soon as
this. So it is good-bye! No wonder I
felt so blue this morning. It is good-bye
for ever to the old life. We shall
meet again, oh yes! but it will be
different. Some day when I’m old and
grown up I will see in a newspaper the
name of a distinguished naturalist and
discoverer, and say, ‘I used to know
him once. He was not at all proud.
He used to pull my hair like any
ordinary mortal. But he doesn’t recognise
me now——’”</p>

<p>“Some day I shall enter a ball-room
and see a little lady sitting by the door
waving her hands in the air, and using
words a mile long, and shall say to myself,
‘Do my eyes deceive me? Is it
indeed the Peggy Pickle of the Past?’
and my host will say, ‘My good sir, that
is the world-famous authoress Mariquita
de Ponsonby Plantagenet Saville!
Stevenson, I assure you, is not in it for
flow of language, and she is so proud of
herself that she won’t speak to anyone
under a belted earl.’”</p>

<p>“That sounds nice!” said Peggy
approvingly, “I should like that, but it
wouldn’t be a ball, you silly boy, it
would be a conversazione where all the
clever and celebrated people of London
were gathered together, ‘To have the
honour of meeting Miss Saville.’
There would be quite a number of
people whom we knew among the Lions.
A very grand Lady Somebody or other,
the beauty of the season—Rosalind of
course—all sparkling with diamonds,
and leaning on the arm of a distinguished-looking
gentleman with orders
on his breast. That’s Arthur. I’m
determined that he shall have orders.
It’s the only thing that could reconcile
me to the loss of the Victoria Cross, and
a dress coat is so uninteresting without
trimmings! A fat lady would be sitting
in a corner prattling about half-a-dozen
subjects all in one moment—that’s
Mellicent, and a tall, lean lady in
spectacles would be imparting useful
information to a dandy with an eyeglass
stuck in one eye—that’s Esther and
Oswald! Oh dear, I wonder—I wonder—I
wonder! It’s like a story book,
Rob, and we are at the end of the first
volume. How much shall we have to
do with each other in the second and
third, and what is going to happen
next—and how—and when?”</p>

<p>“We—we have to part, that’s the
next thing,” said Rob sadly. “Here
comes the carriage, and Arthur is
shouting to us to stop. It’s good-bye,
for the present, Mariquita; there’s no
help for it!”</p>

<p>“At the cross roads!” said Peggy
slowly, and her eye wandered to the signboard
which marked the paths branching
north, south, east, and west. She
stopped short and stood gazing into the
boy’s face, her eyes big and solemn, the
wind blowing her hair into loose little
curls beneath her scarlet cap, while her
mind seized eagerly on the significance
of the position. “At the cross roads,
Rob, to go our different ways! Good-bye,
good-bye! I hate to say it. You—you
won’t forget, and like the horrid
boys at college better than me, will you,
Rob?”</p>

<p>Robert gave a short, strangled little
laugh.</p>

<p>“I think—not! Cheer up, partner!
We will meet again and have a better
time together than we have had yet. The
third volume is always more exciting than
the first. I say we shall, and you know
when I make up my mind to a thing, it
has to be done!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but how?” sighed Peggy
faintly. “But how?” Vague prophecies
of the future were not much comfort
to her in this moment of farewell.
She wanted something more definite,
but Rob had no time to enter into
details. Even as she spoke the carriage
drew up beside them, and while the
occupants congratulated Peggy on having
walked so far and so well, he could
only grip her hand, and take his place
in silence beside his sister.</p>

<p>Lady Darcy bent forward to smile
farewell; Rosalind waved her hand, and
there they were off again, driving swiftly
homewards, while Peggy stood watching,
a solitary figure upon the roadside.</p>

<p>Arthur and his companions hurried
forward to join her, afraid lest she should
be tired and overcome with grief by the
parting with her friend and partner.</p>

<p>“Poor little Peg! She won’t like it a
bit,” said Arthur. “She’s crying! I’m
sure she is.”</p>

<p>“She is putting her handkerchief to
her eyes,” said Mellicent. “Of course,
she is crying!”</p>

<p>“We will give her an arm apiece, and
take her straight back,” said Max
anxiously, “It’s a shame to have left
the poor little soul alone!”</p>

<p>They stared with troubled eyes at the
little figure which stood with its back
turned towards them, in an attitude of
rigid stillness. There was something
pathetic about that stillness, with just
the flutter of the tell-tale handkerchief
to hint at the quivering face that was
hidden from view. The hearts of
Peggy’s companions were very tender
over her at that moment, but even as
they planned words of comfort and
cheer, she wheeled round suddenly and
walked back to meet them.</p>

<p>It was an unusually mild morning for
the season of the year, and the sun was
shining from a cloudless sky. Its rays
fell full upon Peggy’s face as she advanced;
upon reddened eyes, trembling
lips, and two large tears trickling down
her cheeks. It was undeniable that she
was crying, but she carried her head well
back upon her shoulders, rather courting
than avoiding observation, and as she
drew nearer it became abundantly
evident that Peggy had retired in
honour of Mariquita, and that consolations
had better be deferred to a more
promising occasion.</p>

<p>“A most lacerating wind!” she said
coolly. “It draws the moisture to my
eyes. Quite piercingly cold I call it!”
and even Mellicent had not the courage
to contradict.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And here, dear readers, we leave
Peggy Saville at a milestone of her life.
In what direction the cross roads led the
little company of friends, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">{437}</a></span>
windings of the path brought them once
more together, remains still to be told.
It was a strange journey, and in their
travelling they met many friends with
whom all young people are acquainted.
The giant barred the way, and had to be
overcome before the palace could be
reached; the Good Spirit intervened at
the right moment to prevent calamity,
the prince and princess stepped forward
and made life beautiful; for life is the
most wonderful fairy tale that was ever
written, and full of magic to those who
have eyes to see it.</p>

<p>Farewell then to Peggy Pickle, but if
it be the wish of those readers who
have followed her varying fortunes so
far, we may meet again with Mariquita
Saville, in the glory of sweet and twenty,
and learn from her the secret of the
years.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> ISABELLA FYVIE MAYO, Author of “Other People’s Stairs,” “Her Object in Life,” etc.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="ph3">THE FIRST OF THE “SLAINS CASTLE.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I am</span> all curiosity to hear your secret,
Charlie,” pleaded his wife.</p>

<p>“Well, as I tell you, it is your secret
which has given any meaning to mine,”
he said. “It is as if I picked up an
odd-shaped bit of wood, which seemed a
mere chip, but presently you came in with
a puzzle, all fitted, save for one vacant
place, and lo, my chip exactly fills it!”</p>

<p>He had taken up the bulky pocket-book
which lay on the sofa beside him.
He searched through its contents,
selected one letter, and handed it to
Lucy.</p>

<p>“Read it,” he said, “and tell me
what you think.”</p>

<p>Lucy instinctively looked first at the
envelope. The post-mark was “Peterhead”;
the handwriting was strong and
manly.</p>

<p>“Why, it is from your old acquaintance
Captain Grant!” she said.</p>

<p>Charlie nodded.</p>

<p>“Read what he says,” he repeated.</p>

<p>It was not a long letter. The Captain,
who was an old schoolfellow of Charlie’s,
had heard of his illness and wrote to
inquire how he was.</p>

<p>“It is my belief, my boy,” he said,
“that all the medicine you want is a
good draught of salt air taken straight
off the top of the ocean waves. You
can’t get it quite right on the best of
shores. What a pity you can’t come
with me in my fine ship the <em>Slains
Castle</em>. We are going straight to New
Zealand, and then perhaps we shall
trade a little among some of the smaller
islands; but the <em>Slains Castle</em> is a fast
goer, and unless the winds are very
dead against us, we shall be home well
within a year. That’s the sort of thing
that would really do you good, and not
a petty little voyage on a passenger
steamer, where you smell more of the
engines and the cook-room than of the
briny. Can’t you make up your mind
and come with me? Health before
income, old man! If you were by
yourself, I’d press the idea; but, as
there is the little wife, I suppose I
mustn’t. For there is no room to offer
to her on the ship.”</p>

<p>“I shall write and tell him that just
because there is a little wife, he must
press the idea!” cried Lucy, with
shining eyes. “Why, a whole year on
the open sea—you, who love it so much
and are never sea-sick—it would make
a new man of you!” And then her
brave heart quailed secretly at the
thought of the long absence, and the
long silences which lay within it, and
she added kindly, “But might you not
find it a rough life, Charlie, and lonesome?”</p>

<p>Charlie laughed kindly.</p>

<p>“I can trust Grant’s ideas of comfort,”
he said; “they are quite up to wholesome
point, and I want nothing more.
He is good company too, and so are
sailors generally. I could not bear the
thought of any very long journey in a
big passenger steamer with strange
men, possibly gamblers or drunkards,
sharing one’s cabin, the social tone set
by the smoking-room and the bar, and
possibility of the truly awful solitude of
living among two or three hundred people
with not one of whom I might have a
single idea in common! No, dear little
Lucy, if I am to have a really long
voyage, give me a sailing vessel, when I
can secure such advantage as sailing
with Alick Grant.”</p>

<p>“But suppose you should be ill?”
suggested Lucy in a low voice. “There
would be no doctor.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I should be ill!” answered
Charlie cheerfully. “Grant would see
that I was properly taken care of. All
that could be done in my case, he knows
how to do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Challoner paused.</p>

<p>“Even so,” he went on; “it would be
better for you to think of me as lying
quietly in my berth, looked after by an
old friend, and an object of genuine
interest to all his men, than as I should
be on a passenger steamer, with an
over-driven steward and stewardess
running in and out, dancing going on
overhead, and sounds of comic songs
coming from the saloon. No, I should
not like to run risks of serious illness on
a big passenger steamer,” he decided.</p>

<p>He did not remind Lucy—but she
remembered, though she kept silence—that
in the one lengthy ocean voyage he
had ever enjoyed—a business trip to and
from New York—a passenger had met
a frightful death by accident in the
steamer’s saloon, and two days afterwards
a flippant “charade” had been
enacted, with every circumstance of
levity, on the very spot.</p>

<p>“What did you think, Charlie, when
you first got that letter?” asked his
wife. “Did you wish you could go?”</p>

<p>Her husband shook his head.</p>

<p>“We do not wish for what we believe
to be absolutely impossible,” he said.
“As I say, I never gave it another
thought till you brought out your plans
this afternoon. I did not tell you a
word about it, because I thought the
suggestion would only worry you, when
it could not be carried out.”</p>

<p>“But you see now that it could be
done,” said Lucy bravely.</p>

<p>“There is another thing too,” Charlie
went on; “to go in this way will cost
far less than to go in any other. From
what Grant has told me about other
voyages, I know he takes a passenger
in this way at about what one may call
boarding rates, say a hundred pounds
for the whole year. Now, on a steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">{438}</a></span>
one could only be away about three
months at most for that sum, and unless
one took the return journey at once, one
would also have hotel and travelling
expenses. If I go with Grant, Lucy, I
need not take more than one hundred
and a few odd pounds with me, and I
can leave you all the rest of our little
hoard. So thriftily as you will manage,
I believe you need not trouble about
earning, and yet we sha’n’t be penniless
when I get home.”</p>

<p>Lucy answered in nervous haste.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I must do all I can. It will
help to pass the time; it will help me to
bear your being away.”</p>

<p>Charlie put out his hand towards her.</p>

<p>“Little woman,” he said, “is this
going to cost you too much in this way?
What is the good of making any effort
to save me which is to kill you? And
perhaps I don’t need any such saving
after all. Why should I go?”</p>

<p>Lucy rallied herself.</p>

<p>“Of course it will be very terrible to
miss you,” she said, feeling instinctively
that if the part she was playing was to
be accepted, she must not overdo it.
“The days will be very long without
you to wait for and to talk with. I shall
need all I can get to occupy me. But
as for not being able to bear it, Charlie,
I suppose I am made of the same stuff
as other women. Plenty of them have
to bear the same—and worse. Captain
Grant’s wife herself has to bear it, and
from her photographs she does not look
as if it wore her to fiddlestrings.”</p>

<p>“She is used to it,” said Charlie, with a
man’s easy way of “seeing a difference.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I daresay she felt it
worse the first time,” assented Lucy.
“On the other hand, it is always going
on. Almost as soon as one absence
ends another begins. Now, I shall
know that mine is one supreme effort,
and then—reunion!”</p>

<p>“I wish Captain Grant’s wife were
nearer at hand—in London instead of
in Peterhead,” said Charlie. “It would
seem cheery for you wives to be together
at home, while we husbands were together
on the ocean.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps she will come up and
spend a month with me,” remarked
Lucy. “If she comes in the Institute’s
holidays, I should be at leisure to show
her the sights, if she has not seen them
all already. It would be great fun to
have her here.” (Long afterwards Lucy
remembered that little speech.)</p>

<p>“One thing is, if I go, I am not
leaving you lonely, Luce,” mused Charlie.
“There’s Florence and Brand not
very far off.”</p>

<p>Lucy said nothing. Her husband
looked up with the brightness born of a
sudden thought.</p>

<p>“How would you like it if they invited
you to stay with them while I was
away?” he asked. “Hugh could play
with his little cousin, and I’m sure
Pollie could make herself useful, seeing
what hot water they’re always in with
their servants. This house would cost
little shut up, and you could keep an
eye on it, or even get it let as it stands
for a few months out of the twelve.”</p>

<p>“No, Charlie,” said Lucy. There was
an almost fierce decision in her voice.
“No, I can bear to miss you, if I am in
my own place, our place, and can be by
myself when I choose, and am doing all
I can to serve our future. I could not
bear to sit down at dinner-parties, and
to have to dress of an evening, and to
talk small talk in the drawing-room.
The Brands mean to be kind of course,”
she added hastily; “but they like to
have crowds of people about, and I
don’t. Florence had thirty-five callers
at her last weekly ‘afternoon’; while
I’m one of those who think that ‘a
world in purchase of one friend to gain.’
No, Charlie, don’t try to take care of me
in these ways. Trust me with myself.
I know what is good for me. There
are some matters men never quite
understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are to take your own
ways, you must be careful that they
succeed,” said her husband. “One
comfort is, you have Pollie, and can
trust and depend on her. Those cheeks
of yours are thin and pale. I must find
round roses on them when I come back—if
I go! Oh, Lucy, why did you
make these plans, and why did Alick
Grant write that letter? We should
have gone on so happily as we are, and
I should have picked up strength gradually.
Why has this come into our
heads?”</p>

<p>“I think because it is the will of God
that you should go,” answered Lucy
with sweet reverence. “I thought so
all the while when it was only my own
plans, which were working out so well.
I think so more than ever now, Charlie,
when I find that all the time you, as it
were, were holding the other end of the
same stick.”</p>

<p>“Shall we put the matter to one more
test?” said Charlie. “Shall I write to
Grant asking when he sails and if he
will take me for the year at one hundred
pounds, telling him that if he can, and
if I can be ready by his date, I will
entertain the idea.”</p>

<p>“You can be ready by any date if
Dr. Ivery thinks you are strong enough,”
said Lucy, “and we could afford more
than one hundred. If this is the path
of Providence, Charlie, ought we to be
turned aside by these things?”</p>

<p>“Such a letter will not bind me
either way,” returned her husband, “it
is purely tentative; and yet if the date
and the terms prove suitable, the leading
will seem the clearer. I will write at
once, and until we get Grant’s answer,
we will not say a word on the matter to
anybody.”</p>

<p>The epistle was soon written, and
Lucy herself hurried on her bonnet and
ran with it to the post, lest Pollie should
not be quick enough to catch the night
mail for the north.</p>

<p>“I feel sure you are to go,” said Lucy.
And as two or three days passed by
without an answer, she hung upon her
husband’s presence as those do who
count the running down sands of a dear
joy. She could soothe herself only by
doing something for Charlie, though it
was only pathetic little preparations for
the possible departure. Of course there
was no use thinking of “outfit” until
that departure was definitely decided.
But there were “thin places” to be
darned in the fine, carefully-kept underclothing,
and all the three guineas she
had got for her sketch, went to procure
little supplementary comforts and conveniences
which would be certainly
useful whether Charlie went away or
remained at home.</p>

<p>It was indeed a waiting time, and
waiting times invariably try nerves and
spirits, even though so strong a self-control
be set upon these, that they
may not tamper with temper or will.
Lucy Challoner never dared to be idle
for a moment. She felt that she must
hold herself with a strong hand. When
it seemed to her that Pollie was rather
self-absorbed, less interested in her
work, and indeed almost negligent,
Lucy set it all down to her own
imagination, fevered by restrained excitement.</p>

<p>In the course of that waiting time,
Florence Brand put in an appearance
at the little verandahed house. She
came in the afternoon, and Charlie was
asleep. For this Lucy was secretly
thankful, being always unable to realise
that Florence did not irritate Charlie—who
was a woman and not his own sister—as
she often did herself—a woman and
a sister! Pollie was so slow to admit
the visitor, or the visitor was so impatient,
that the door-bell was rung
twice, the second time with such vigour
that Lucy feared her husband would be
startled from his slumbers, and flew to
open the door herself.</p>

<p>“What! You have to do this yourself,
now, do you?” cried Mrs. Brand before
she had crossed the threshold. “How’s
Charlie? Getting all right, I suppose,
or we should have heard. I had a fine
time at the seaside, it would have done
me worlds of good to have stayed there
another week. But I saw so many high-class
autumn sales being advertised, and
I’ve so many things to buy, that I thought
I’d best come straight back. If you’re
busy, I sha’n’t interrupt you. I can
only stay five minutes. I did not mean
to call when I left home, but since I’ve
been out, I’ve heard something that I’m
determined you shall hear at once.
Prepare for a shock!”</p>

<p>Lucy’s face grew so white that it
startled even Mrs. Brand.</p>

<p>“Dear me, child,” she said, “it is
not really anything; nineteen people
out of twenty would not mind a bit,
though they might be angry. But I
know it will startle your confiding
trustfulness. Your treasure Pollie is on
the eve of giving you notice because she
is going to be married!”</p>

<p>Lucy Challoner sat down. She felt
her strength gone from her. In another
moment she rallied, remembering that
she had to hold the fort of domestic
serenity for Charlie’s sake, and that she
must not yet reveal to Florence the
full force of the blow she had given
her.</p>

<p>“How did you hear this?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I heard it at your Italian warehouse,”
Florence answered. “You
know Jem has an idea that they keep
better curry powder than anybody else.
So this afternoon I looked in there with
an order, and to pay a little account.
That took me to the desk, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">{439}</a></span>
girl-clerk sits. She has often seen you
and me together, and of course she had
heard of Charlie’s illness. So says she,
‘I hope Mr. Challoner is better,
ma’am?’ ‘Oh, dear, yes,’ I replied,
‘I daresay he is nearly as well as he
will ever be. He will always be delicate.’
‘I’m so sorry, ma’am,’ she said.
‘It’s so sad for Mrs. Challoner and the
dear little boy, and what a pity it is she
should be troubled about a new servant
at such a time.’ ‘A new servant!’ I
cried in amaze. ‘Oh, perhaps I should
not have spoken,’ said she. ‘Hasn’t
her maid given notice yet? I know
she has arranged to be married at
Christmas.’”</p>

<p>“There may be some mistake,”
observed Lucy. “But thank you for
telling me. I only wish Pollie had told
me herself. I did not know even that
she had a sweetheart.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brand laughed.</p>

<p>“She may not have known that
herself very long,” she said. “These
girls are generally of an opinion that
‘happy’s the wooing that’s not long undoing.’
When do her wages fall due?”</p>

<p>“The day after to-morrow,” said Lucy
drearily.</p>

<p>“This is only the first of October,”
commented Mrs. Brand. “If she gives
you notice now, she will be away by the
first of November. I should not wonder
if she doesn’t give you notice for another
month. Well, you’ve had her more than
seven years, so you may think yourself
lucky. The worst of it is that a change
comes harder in such a case than when
one is always changing as I am. I
must be going now, Lucy. And don’t
you fret. I’ll help you to look for
another girl. I rather enjoy the fun.
But I sympathise with you, my dear, for
I didn’t like the task once, but practice
makes perfect, and now I expect nothing
and am never disappointed.”</p>

<p>She was gone, Lucy closing the hall
door softly behind her that Charlie
might not be roused. She wanted to
make herself more accustomed to this
new aspect of life, ere the tinkle of his
little handbell should summon her to
his side.</p>

<p>The first thing was to question Pollie.
“There may be some mistake,” Lucy
repeated to herself. Yet she felt a
secret conviction that there was none.</p>

<p>She did not ring the bell and “summon
Pollie to her presence.” She had
the thoughtful woman’s habit of seldom
ringing the bell to claim the attendance
of the solitary servant. She went
towards the head of the kitchen stairs
and lingered there a moment. She
heard Pollie walk across the kitchen,
and then the rattle of some tin vessels.
She made up her mind to go down and
face the worst at once.</p>

<p>Somehow the kitchen did not look
quite so pleasant as usual. It was
clean and fairly tidy, but the things last
used were not cleared away, and the
dresser lacked the glass with a few
flowers which generally adorned it.
Pollie was busy at the fire-place. She
looked over her shoulder at her mistress,
but did not turn round, and went on
with what she was doing.</p>

<p>She was a comely personable girl with
a good head and a trim figure. Perhaps
there was a little hardness about her
mouth, or it might be that she was
setting her teeth in face of what was
coming.</p>

<p>“Pollie,” said the mistress very
gently, “I have just been told that
you are thinking of leaving us and
getting married?”</p>

<p>Pollie did not answer quickly. She
went on doing something with great
energy.</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, yes,” she said; “it
is so.”</p>

<p>“And when is it to be, Pollie?” asked
Mrs. Challoner.</p>

<p>“I’m to be married at Christmas,”
Pollie answered with great firmness.</p>

<p>“Then I am to take your notice at
once?” said Mrs. Challoner.</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, yes. I’d like to leave
on the 1st of November. I’ve things to
do. But if you would like me to stay a
week or two longer, I’d be willing to
oblige you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Challoner reflected for a moment.
It is well-nigh impossible to accept a
favour from one who has suddenly cut
us down to the bare legal rights of our
position.</p>

<p>“No, Pollie, thank you,” she said;
“you can go at the time that suits you
best.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, m’m,” said Pollie, still
rubbing vigorously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Challoner did not feel as if she
could drop the matter right off here. It
did not seem even fair to this girl, who
had been with her and had worked
faithfully for her for seven years, not to
let her know exactly what feelings her
present course had evoked.</p>

<p>“Pollie,” she began very gently, “is
not all this rather sudden?”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, you’ve got your proper
notice, and I’ve said I’d not stand on
giving you a week or two extra. What
more can I do?” said Pollie.</p>

<p>“That is quite true, Pollie. But look
at it in this light—if you had only been
with me for two or three months, you
would be obliged to do as much as you
are doing now. Don’t you think something
else comes into the matter when
people have been together for years and
have grown to rely on each other and to
feel as if each other would be always
there, unless they knew that something
was coming to part them?”</p>

<p>“I was not to know that you mightn’t
get rid of me any day, ma’am,” said
Pollie. “It seems like as if there might
be changes.”</p>

<p>“Pollie, do you really think I would
not at once have told you of any possible
change which, if it occurred, might interfere
with you?” asked Mrs. Challoner.
“Legal notices are necessary between
everybody, strangers or friends; but full
and timely warning beforehand is surely
due from those who have been long
associated. Don’t you feel you would
have had this if change had threatened
from my side?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, m’m,” said Pollie
rather sullenly. “Ladies don’t always
think of those things. Girls have to look
after themselves.”</p>

<p>“But I am certain you would have
felt hurt,” said Mrs. Challoner. “If
not, you can have never had much
regard for me or confidence in me.”</p>

<p>Pollie began to cry.</p>

<p>“I ain’t leaving you to go to another
place, m’m,” she said. “I’d never
have done that. I’ve been tempted,
though you’ve never heard of it. ‘Wages
isn’t everything,’ I’ve always answered.
But this is different.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is, Pollie,” Mrs. Challoner
responded patiently. “But I am
the more taken by surprise because I
never dreamed you had a lover. I hope
you are not doing anything rashly,
Pollie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he hasn’t been any lover; but
I’ve known him long enough!” gasped
Pollie. “I didn’t know as he thought
anything about me. Only when I said
to him I thought there would be changes
an’ I’d never take another London
service, he ups and speaks out, thinking,
I suppose, that I’d go away and he’d lose
me altogether. And at Christmas he
gets a week’s holiday, and that’s why
we’ll be married then and go down to
Leeds to see his mother. ‘We’ll get it
over,’ says he, ‘and do the courtin’
afterwards.’ I’m sure there’s been none
yet,” Pollie added with a dash of feminine
scorn.</p>

<p>“Well, Pollie, you know I am sorry
to part from you, and it is sadder still
when we have just been through so
much anxiety together. But I hope
you’ll be happy. I wish you had told
me about it yourself. It is hard to hear
such things from other people.”</p>

<p>“Other people might mind their own
business, m’m,” said Pollie, with some
spirit. “There’s some people who are
a deal too busy with their tongues.”</p>

<p>“But they only told the truth,” Mrs.
Challoner suggested.</p>

<p>“If they hadn’t had no truth to tell,
they’d have had a say about something
or ’nother, I guess!” cried Pollie,
heaping up negatives in her flurry.</p>

<p>“Well, Pollie,” said her mistress,
“all I have now to ask is that you will
not mention your leaving to your master—at
least, at present. You can understand
that we must keep all worry from
him while he is regaining strength. In
a day or two I will tell you my special
reason for asking this silence.”</p>

<p>“‘He’ ought to be very good to me
to be taking me from a place where I’ve
been treated like as I’ve been here,”
reflected Pollie when Mrs. Challoner
had left the kitchen. “And here I’d
have been for years, maybe—and maybe
for ever—and certain never in no such
hurry would I have jumped at any
journeyman tailor, if it hadn’t been for
that Mrs. Brand a-shaking of her head
and saying I must be prepared for
changes—and them soon too—she feared
the master wasn’t for long, and it was
a good thing the mistress had their
house to turn to. And when a woman’s
getting nigh thirty and changes begins
to—to be talked about, it comes as a
sort of Godsend when she’s asked to
change her name! But how I’ll get
along without Master Hugh, it beats me
to know!”</p>

<p>That night Lucy Challoner never closed
her eyes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="ph3">BROTHER AND SISTER.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox w150">
<img class="idropcap" src="images/i_440.jpg" width="150" height="255" alt='"I' /></div>

<p><span class="uppercase">call</span> it cruel
of them to
separate us!
They might at
least have
let us be together!”
cried Sheila,
with tears in
her voice, if
not in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, but
we shall not be
very far apart.
We can see
each other
most days,
and you will
have a nice
home with
Uncle and Aunt Cossart—more what you
have been used to—a big country house.
Uncle Tom lives in the town to be near
the works; but he says it is an easy
walk to get out to Cossart Place.”</p>

<p>Sheila gave a rather scornful toss to
her handsome head.</p>

<p>“Cossart Place! I hate that pretentious
way of calling one’s house by
one’s own name! Oscar, aren’t these
relations of ours rather vulgar, purse-proud
people? Papa must have had
some reason for keeping us away from
them all these years.”</p>

<p>Oscar was silent for a few moments,
and then he said slowly—</p>

<p>“You know, Sheila, our father was
rather a proud man. He thought a
good deal of birth and family, and of
being one of the Cholmondeleys of
Warwickshire. He married our beautiful
mother for love; but he took her right
away from her family—he told me so
himself as he lay dying—and she never
saw any of them again. She had only
quite a small fortune then. The Cossarts
have got rich since her marriage.
But our father’s property has been
dwindling and dwindling, and he has
dipped again and again into capital,
and everything is mortgaged up to the
hilt, as Mr. Dart calls it. Sheila, I am
afraid there will be very little left for us
except the little fortune of our mother’s,
which was settled upon her and her
children.”</p>

<p>Sheila understood very little of business,
and Oscar not much more; but
he had received confidences from their
dying father, and had had interviews with
the family lawyer, so that he was better
acquainted with the prospect before them
than the sister.</p>

<p>“Father thought at the last that he
had made a mistake in holding aloof
from the Cossarts. He wrote both to
Uncle Cossart and Uncle Tom, and
they are our guardians. I think they
mean to be kind to us, though they
could not at once get away to be here
for the funeral. But Uncle Tom will
come almost at once to look into
things; and he is going to give me a
berth at the works. He says that in his
letter.”</p>

<p>“I call that the horridest thing of
all!” flashed out Sheila. “You to be
stuck down at a desk or something, in
some chemical works, or whatever it is!
Why can’t they let you finish your course
at Oxford? Mother’s money would be
lots for that!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but then what would be
the good?” asked Oscar gravely.
“No, Sheila, I have seen too much
of what Oxford does for poor men, to
want to finish my three years there.
I’ve no great gifts. I should only take
an ordinary degree. I should have no
chance of fellowship or tutorship there,
and I’ve no gift for teaching. It’s
much better really to go into business
young, where one has a chance of
pushing one’s way. Lots of fellows
would give their ears for my chances at
our uncles’ works. As I can’t be a
country gentleman like our father, and
be master of the dear old place, I’d
sooner go right away and start fair at
something altogether different.”</p>

<p>Sheila heaved a deep sigh as her eyes
travelled from her brother’s grave face,
out through the open window and across
the familiar landscape of wood and
water.</p>

<p>It was a lovely February day—one
of those days which come as a foretaste
of summer, when the sun shines with
power, and all the air is full of scents
of spring, and one forgets that winter
is not yet gone, and begins to welcome
the promise of the year.</p>

<p>“I never thought we should have to
leave the dear old home. Is it certain
that it must go, Oscar? Surely father
could not have meant to leave things so
bad for us?”</p>

<p>“Father was not fond of business,”
said Oscar slowly. “He did not go
into things carefully enough. The
property was burdened when he came
into it, and, you know, land has been
going down ever since. We will not
blame him, Sheila; other people have
had losses too. Mr. Dart says that
hundreds and thousands of people have
been placed just as we are these last
years. Indeed, we are better off than
many; for there is that little fortune of
our mother’s—five thousand pounds well
invested—which brings us in a little
income, and there may be something left
from the estate when things are wound
up, though it won’t be much, I can see.
And we have the Cossarts, who will give
us a home each. I think it is rather
fine of them to come forward to help us,
seeing how their sister was kept quite
away from them after her marriage.”</p>

<p>Sheila looked up with a little quick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">{441}</a></span>
eager glance in her big grey eyes—those
Irish eyes, which, like her name,
she had inherited from her grandmother—her
father’s mother—who had been a
notable beauty in her day. Sheila was
not a beauty; but she had an attractive
face, and a winning and appealing
manner. She had always been the pet
and the darling of the house, and she
seemed to claim affection and notice as
a natural right.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we live together, Oscar,
just you and I together, in some dear
little cottage, on our mother’s money?
I would keep the house nice, and grow
flowers in the garden; and you could
find something to do; and we would be
so happy in our little home.”</p>

<p>She put her hand upon his, and he
stroked it and smiled;
but he shook his head
too.</p>

<p>“It sounds nice,
Sheila; but it wouldn’t
really be practicable.
You don’t know anything
about the worries
of small means, and I
should get no opening
if I refused Uncle
Tom’s offer. Besides,
you see, we have no
choice at present. We
are both minors; I
sha’n’t be of age for a
year, and you are only
eighteen. Our uncles
are our guardians, and
we have to do what
they settle for us. Mr.
Dart says that what
they have suggested
is the kindest thing
possible. Some day,
I hope, if you don’t
marry, we shall be able
to have a home of our
own together. But for
the next few years we
must make up our
minds to let other
people settle things for
us, and be grateful to
them for taking the
burden and worry off
our shoulders.”</p>

<p>Oscar could be
thankful for this. He
had seen just enough
of life in his year at
Oxford, and in the examination,
under the
lawyer’s direction, into
his father’s involved
affairs, to be aware
that its battle could be
a very hard and strenuous
matter, and that
his father had been
carried away by the
tide of misfortune instead
of seeking to
stem it. He could
almost feel thankful
that he was not called
upon to fight any arduous
up-hill battle—that
things had gone
so far that nothing
would avail but a clean
sweep. Oscar loved his home—loved it
almost as well as Sheila did. If he could
have lived peacefully and prosperously
there, as his fathers had apparently done
before him, he would have asked nothing
better, and would have sought to do his
duty to those about and beneath him.
But he had an elastic and hopeful temperament,
and he did not dislike the
prospect of a complete change in his
manner of life. He had a turn for
electrical engineering, and his uncle
had said something about an electrical
branch in the works of Cossart &amp; Sons.
Congenial employment might be found
for him, he thought. He had been
through much sorrow of heart and worry
of mind during the past weeks since his
father’s death; but now he was beginning
to see his way out of the tangle,
and to look forward hopefully to what
lay beyond.</p>

<div class="figcenter w550">
<img src="images/i_441.jpg" width="550" height="685" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BROTHER AND SISTER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sheila’s thoughts had also gone off
on a private expedition. But, after a
short pause, she spoke with great
decision.</p>

<p>“I shall never marry, Oscar. Marrying
makes people stupid. I know that,
because all the girls who go and get
married are quite spoiled directly. It
begins as soon as they are engaged.
Besides, most of them go away, and
one forgets about them. I shall be an
old maid, and keep your house for you.
It will be something to look forward to
whilst I am living with Uncle Cossart.
Why can’t I go to Uncle Tom’s with you?
It would be so much more amusing.”</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">{442}</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, they seem to have it all
arranged for us, and we can’t exactly
ask them to alter. But we’ll see all
about it when Uncle Tom comes. He’ll
tell us everything.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Cossart was the younger
of the brothers who now were the heads
of a thriving business in one of the
eastern counties. Their father had
begun from small means; but prudence,
upright dealing, and industry, combined
with shrewdness and skill, had worked
up the business to something very considerable.
He had died a wealthy man,
but his daughter had not succeeded to
any farther portion of his wealth. The
old Cossart had been hurt and offended
at the way in which his child had been
separated from her own people through
Mr. Cholmondeley’s pride. He had
made no complaint, but he had felt it
keenly. The sons took it more quietly.
They were busy men, and possibly the
knowledge that what would have been
their sister’s portion had fallen to their
share, disposed them to take the matter
with equanimity. They used to write
and send presents at Christmas, just to
show there was no ill-feeling, and as
long as Mrs. Cholmondeley lived she
had always done the same. When it
was told to the Cossart brothers that
Mr. Cholmondeley had died rather
suddenly, leaving his affairs in a very
involved state, and asking their help and
guardianship for his two children, the
response had been prompt and kindly.</p>

<p>“I shall come as soon as I can
possibly arrange to be away from the
works,” Mr. Tom Cossart had written.
“My brother is laid up with the gout
and is unable to move, and I cannot be
present at the funeral as I have too
many important engagements to fulfil.
But I shall come immediately afterwards
and do my best to assist in the winding
up of affairs.”</p>

<p>He had written also to his nephew,
stating briefly that there would be a
home for them with their relatives and
a place for him in the works. Now
they were waiting with some excitement
of mind for the arrival of the unknown
uncle, in whose hands their future seemed
to lie.</p>

<p>“I hope he will be nice and kind!”
cried Sheila, as she paced the big hall
with excited steps. “I want to like
him if I can; but what shall we do if he
is harsh and unkind, or”—here she
lowered her voice and added, as if half
afraid of her own imaginings—“if he is
dreadfully common and vulgar?”</p>

<p>“He is our mother’s brother,” said
Oscar gravely. “We must try always
to remember that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but mother had been sent away
to a good school, and father saw her
and fell in love with her when she was
on a visit just after she left. She had
scarcely lived at home at all. I don’t
think that is any proof. Oscar, shall I
have to kiss him when he comes?”</p>

<p>“I think you had better, Sheila. He
is our uncle. I think he will expect it.”</p>

<p>Sheila made a little grimace; but she
had been petted all her life, and kissing
came easily to her.</p>

<p>“I wonder why girls are expected to
kiss everybody and be kissed? Boys
get off. It isn’t quite fair. But I’ll try
to be as good as I can.”</p>

<p>Sheila was trying to keep a brave
face, though her heart was heavy to-night.
The coming of Uncle Tom
seemed to emphasise the fact that the
father’s place was for ever empty; that
it was a stranger who must in future
rule their lives for them—at any rate,
for the next year or two. The blank in
the house was keenly felt at all times,
although perhaps a little less keenly
than it would have been had Mr.
Cholmondeley not been much of a
recluse during the latter years of his
life. It seemed so strange that a visitor
should be arriving, and that there should
be only the son and daughter to welcome
him.</p>

<p>Sheila choked back a sob more than
once, as she stood listening for the
crunch of wheels upon the gravel, which
would herald the approach of the
carriage.</p>

<p>It was like the beginning of the end.
When once Uncle Tom had arrived, the
old home would not seem like their own
any longer. The guardian would be
there to look after and arrange everything;
and before very long they would
have to leave—never to return.</p>

<p>As that thought come into Sheila’s
mind, she ceased her excited pacing
and came and stood beside the glowing
hearth, her eyes full of unshed tears as
she gazed into the heart of the fire.</p>

<p>Oscar saw the tears and came and
put his arm about her. He knew very
well the nature of the thoughts within her.</p>

<p>“Sheila,” he said softly, “we must
try to be brave and good. We know
that God will take care of us as much in
one place as another.”</p>

<p>She nodded her head, and a great
drop fell glistening down. She pulled
Oscar’s hand more closely round her.</p>

<p>“I don’t think things are as real to
me as they are to you, Oscar. I like to
be taken care of by somebody I can see.
Papa always did, and now he is gone,
and they are going to take you away
from me too.”</p>

<p>“I shall be quite near, Sheila; we
shall always be meeting.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t like being in the same house.”</p>

<p>“You will have Uncle and Aunt
Cossart, and I think there will be some
cousins too. I know Uncle Tom has
children; I’m not quite so sure about
Uncle Cossart.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I sha’n’t like them. I don’t
like everybody,” began Sheila; but then
she caught herself up quickly and added,
“But I am going to try and be good,
Oscar, I really am. Perhaps I’ve been
too happy all this time—made too much
of. It may be good for me to have
some snubbing now. I’ll try not to
mind very much—to take it patiently—like
the early Christians, you know.
When I was little I used to think it
might be rather nice to be persecuted.”</p>

<p>Oscar smiled a little, and over Sheila’s
face there glimmered a flickering smile,
as though she were half amused at
her own fancies. The firelight played
over her face and form as she stood in
its rosy glow. She was a little over the
average height, and was growing graceful
and maidenly, though a year or two
back she had been rather a hoyden in
appearance, with long limbs and a good
many angles, and a mane of wavy
brown hair tumbling over her shoulders.
Now the long plain black dress, a little
open at neck and wrists—for it was
close upon dinner-time—seemed to give
grace and dignity to the figure, and to
heighten the clearness of the girl’s complexion.
The plentiful brown hair was
coiled about the head. The big grey
eyes were arched over by brows of the
same dusky tint, and the features of the
face were well cut, though not quite
regular, and very mobile in their play
of expression. It was the constantly
varying expression which gave to Sheila’s
face its chief charm. It was like an
April morning—always changing from
gay to grave and from grave to gay.
Gaiety certainly predominated in the
play of lips and eyes; but there were
many stormy or appealing or wistful
expressions flitting constantly over the
face. Sheila was accustomed to get
her own way with everybody about her;
and her big appealing eyes were answerable
for a good deal of the spoiling she
received.</p>

<p>Oscar was slight and tall, well-featured
and very gentlemanly in appearance,
with a quiet, attractive face and a very
bright smile, which was, however, much
more rare than Sheila’s. They were
not much alike; but that seemed only
to strengthen the bond between them.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Oscar quickly. “I
hear the carriage!”</p>

<p>Sheila turned a little pale, and took a
step or two forward.</p>

<p>“It is Uncle Tom!” she said; and
the next minute the butler had thrown
open the door and a figure well wrapped
up for the wintry journey was seen
entering the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Cossart had come!</p>

<p class="ph3">GOING ON PILGRIMAGE.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“<span class="smcap">A glorious</span> morning!” was our remark as
we met at breakfast on March 28th. “Just
the day for a pilgrimage to Mar Saba.”</p>

<p>The hour was early, but long before we had
risen the shouts of Ameen and a muleteer
mingling with the tramp of horses announced
the arrival of part of our escort.</p>

<p>The Arab is a restless as well as a vociferating
person, and cannot comprehend why the
average Saxon goes to bed regularly at night,
sleeps till morning, and keeps awake all day.
For himself, well, the hour of repose and the
nature of his couch are matters of perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">{443}</a></span>
indifference. He takes his dog sleep like
Sairey Gamp imbibed her spirits—“when so
dispoged.”</p>

<p>If you tell him your wish is to start at
eight in the morning, behold, he is knocking
at your door before sunrise, and imploring you
to make haste. He is convinced in his own
mind that the intervening hours will be spent
in the absurdities of washing and dressing.
If you remonstrate, he shrugs his shoulders,
and you may presently hear him confiding to
his friend, that “the English are a strange
people. True, Allah made them, but He
alone can understand them!”</p>

<p>We were very punctual on this particular
morning, and at seven o’clock had mounted
our rough little horses, whose wonderful necklaces
and charms formed no small part of their
equipment.</p>

<p>The muleteer highly entertained us. He
was a round-faced, scantily-clothed youth,
whose evident pride in his cattle was manifest
as he pointed to their decorations. He greeted
us with broad grins and “Bon jour!” These
words being the only scrap of a foreign tongue
he had picked up, they were employed in
season and out of season. Whenever one of
our party looked pleased, or nodded kindly to
him, he would stiffen himself, beam on her,
and, with a fine air, roll out the salutation,
“Bon jour!”</p>

<p>Our cavalcade now formed up, and we
started off in high spirits, prepared for any
adventure that might fall to our lot. Ameen,
of course, led the van, his black horse gorgeously
dressed in trappings of “barbaric
splendour,” and he seated on a wondrous
saddle, his purple silk shawl or <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">kaffieh</i> tied
round his head and falling behind in graceful
folds over the voluminous abbah, or cloak.
The pair were imposing-looking objects in
dignified contrast to the ludicrous figures of
“Bon Jour” and his beast, who followed next
in the procession.</p>

<p>His horse was a fearful and wonderful
creature, carefully guarded against the influence
of the evil eye by fantastic festoons
of blue beads and shells which depended
from his neck and mane and tail. Stacked
upon his back were cooking pots, luncheon
baskets, sunshades, wraps, and other gear,
flanked by bursting saddle-bags. In the
midst of these articles sat “Bon Jour,” complacently
ambling on in the jog-trot style
peculiar to his tribe, his brown legs dangling
down, his leathern belt decorated with</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A bottle on each side</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To keep his balance true.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We brought up the rear demurely enough,
trying to get our mettlesome steeds under
control, with the help of “Bon Jour,” who,
turning round and facing us, would yell in
Arabic one moment to them, and the next
encourage us with—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Nods and becks, and wreathèd smiles,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and the inevitable salutation in the French
tongue, looking for all the world like a
travelling showman on parade!</p>

<p>The first part of our journey lay along the
Bethlehem road, which was fairly good, but
has, I understand, been vastly improved for
the German Emperor’s visit. On either side
were smiling plains and grey olive groves,
dressed in the lovely fresh hues of spring.
Carpets of delicate flowers were spread on
the roadside—for there are no hedges in
Palestine—the air was soft and pleasant and
everything took its colouring from the joyous
morning.</p>

<p>The tomb of Rachel claimed our attention
for a moment. We were quite familiar with
its appearance from the many illustrations
we had seen, so that the simple dome-like
structure on the wayside seemed an old friend.
Pious Jews, Christians, and Moslems offer
their prayers at its shrine, and apparently derive
equal benefit from their devotions.</p>

<p>A little beyond, on the slope of a hill, the
pretty village of Beit Jala gleamed and
glittered in the sunlight. The city of Kish,
the father of King Saul, originally stood there.
Was it to that hill, I wonder, the young,
handsome Saul, after his election as King of
Israel, returned when he “went home to
Gibeah, and with him a band of men whose
hearts God had touched”?</p>

<p>An element of discord was not wanting as
we rode through the peaceful valleys. Overhead
wheeled a great vulture, hungrily waiting
to swoop down on some dead carcase—a
camel or a donkey perhaps—and devour its
prey. On a crag close by sat a majestic
eagle, his piercing eyes boldly fixed on the
sun. The solitary bird seemed a fitting type
of the departed glory of Israel.</p>

<p>It was pleasant further on to notice signs
of human life. Shepherds were tending their
flocks and playing on “David’s” pipes—a
terrible instrument, by the way, giving forth
horrible sounds suggestive of Highland bagpipes
in the hands and mouth of a beginner—shepherd-boys
were hurling stones from a
primitive sling (knitted in worsted) with marvellous
skill and true aim at an imaginary
Goliath.</p>

<p>In contrast to these pastoral amusements,
the solemn Moslem, with his shoes carefully
removed, his face towards Mecca, performed
his religious duties on the roadside, going
through his prayers and prostrations unmoved
by the curious glances of strangers and pilgrims
from other lands.</p>

<p>We were now nearing the birthplace of our
Saviour, through which city we had to pass.
On the east is a narrow valley called the
Shepherds’ Plain. Even on this early spring
morning it looked a bare treeless spot, with
stony slopes shining white, and a few crumbling
ruins. It was here, according to tradition,
that the angelic messengers announced
the glad tidings to the wondering shepherds
and sang the magnificent “Gloria in Excelsis.”</p>

<p>I am bound to say that my enthusiasm was
not kindled by the sight of those holy fields.
Indeed, my preconceived ideas received a rude
shock—as they often did during our travels—and
I came to the woeful conclusion that on
the whole it was more pleasing to visit in
imagination the sacred spots in Palestine than
go on pilgrimage to the actual places.</p>

<p>Just as the sun pointed to nine o’clock,
we were entering the straggling city of
Bethlehem. We had, as in all Oriental
towns, to pick our way carefully through the
narrow undulating streets with their hillocks
of rubbish and valleys of mud. We were
occasionally jammed up against a wall to
avoid too close contact with the strings of
camels laden with stone for repairing the roads
for the expected Imperial visit.</p>

<p>“Bon Jour” of course indulged in lively
altercations with the camel drivers; he also
unceremoniously pushed aside men, women,
and children who happened to be in the line
of route. Miss B. told us that a quantity of
very bad language was freely dispensed on
both sides, but it apparently bred no ill feeling,
as we afterwards saw “Bon Jour” and one of
the men, who had most violently assaulted him
with words, walking amicably across the square.</p>

<p>One cannot fail to be greatly struck by the
bright hopeful looks both of the city and its
inhabitants, who, we were told, were all
Christians. Indeed, it was plainly visible in
the thriving aspect of the place and energy of
the people, who were busily employed, that
Moslem inertness had no stronghold here.
The sound of the hammer, the whirr of the
wheel, and the grating of the file fell pleasantly
on the ear as the industrious workers fashioned
the great pearl shells into beads, brooches, and
beautifully carved ornaments.</p>

<p>The men and women of Bethlehem are
much fairer in complexion than other natives
of Syria. The girls are celebrated for their
beauty, their large soft blue eyes and brown
hair giving them a European look which is
almost startling. Their lovely dress adds to
their picturesqueness, and the tall cap, covered
with gold and silver coins, which the married
women wear, gives height to their graceful
figures.</p>

<p>There was not much time on this occasion
to make more than casual observations, for
time was pressing. We rode into the great
square and dismounted near the Church of the
Nativity, which now stands inside the fortress
Monastery of the Virgin.</p>

<p>While our guides took the horses to be
watered, we wandered about the open cemetery,
alternately “meditating among the tombs” of
the brave Crusaders who lie buried there, and
watching the animated scene in the portion
of the square used as a market.</p>

<p>We laughed heartily at one unwary traveller
who, having yielded weakly to the persuasive
powers of an importunate shopman, was
literally besieged by half-a-dozen others. The
unfortunate object of these attentions looked
simply desperate, the perspiration pouring
from his face as his enemies pulled him this
way, pushed him that, shouting and yelling
in the Arabic tongue, and gesticulating
menacingly with one hand while they held
on to him with the other. He could not
understand, poor fellow, a word they said,
and evidently thought they were going to
murder him. We saw him finally dragged
into a shop by the two strongest, while the
other four waited outside for their victim to
emerge, when the attack would be resumed.
We wondered whether his friends would come
to the rescue!</p>

<p>The few remaining minutes at our disposal
were spent in visiting the famous study of
St. Jerome, a gloomy cell cut in the rock in
the vaults of the Church. It was here the
great Father spent so many years of his life
in translating the Scriptures into the noble
Vulgate. He was helped in his herculean
task by Paula and her daughter Eustochia—learned
Roman ladies—who followed Jerome
to Bethlehem and founded a convent there over
which he presided. Their tombs, with that of
Eusebius, are in the vaults. The Grotto of
the Nativity we left for another day.</p>

<p>We were joined in the square by a fine-looking
Arab, with loins girded, and his bare
feet thrust into red shoes. He saluted us
gravely and with much dignity. Pointing to
an ancient rifle (which was slung across his
shoulders and was patched up in an original
and striking manner, calculated to burst if by
any chance it was loaded), he informed us
that he had been appointed our escort across
the wilderness and, further, that he would guard
our lives and property as he would his own.</p>

<p>Miss B., who translated his remarks, told
us not to be alarmed, for if by any chance we
should be attacked by robbers, Mustapha
would be two miles ahead of us, and we
should run no danger of being killed by the
explosion of his gun! This we felt was severe
on our aristocratic-looking defender.</p>

<p>The horses and their attendants now came
up, “Bon Jour’s” beast more grotesquely
laden than before. We were soon in the
saddle, and winding round the eastern corner
of the Monastery, turned our backs on civilisation,
and entered the dreary wilderness called
in Scripture Jeshimon or Solitude.</p>

<p>For the next four or five hours we rode
through this region, which in winter must be
ghastly indeed. Even the glory of the spring
flowers, which thinly covered its otherwise
naked, soft, chalky slopes, failed to enliven it.
Everything but the flowers was of one colour—the
glaring ridges, the fantastic peaks, the sharp
spurs, the rugged rocks, the narrow ravines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">{445}</a></span>
with their stony beds, the camels, the foxes,
and the dogs all were a kind of tawny yellow.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a></span>
<img src="images/i_444.jpg" width="500" height="698" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BETHLEHEM. (<em>From the painting by Paul Linke.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>We saw neither tree nor water. A few
black tents of the Bedawîn formed a welcome
relief from the blinding glare. Not a sound
disturbed these solitudes, except the occasional
bark of a dog in the tents below. Ameen
told us that the people living in this region
are distinct from other races, their dialect is
different from that of other districts, their
traditions, habits, and dress are those of an
entirely different people.</p>

<p>Our brave little horses accomplished that
fearfully hot journey in grand style; they
carried us up those awful rocks and along the
edges of precipitous steeps which filled our
minds with horror.</p>

<p>Ameen and “Bon Jour” sang their monotonous
Arabic songs in shrill keys, or dozed
in their saddles. Mustapha untiringly walked
on with his peculiar swinging gait, often lost
to sight, but turning up again, bearing in
his hands bouquets of exquisite flowers, which
he offered to us with a grace of manner which
added much to the pretty gift.</p>

<p>The heat grew more and more intense.
Not a breath of wind gave relief. I can well
believe one writer, who says, “There are
probably few places in Asia where the sun
beats down with as fierce a heat and irresistible
power as in the desert of Judah.”</p>

<p>It was two o’clock before we dismounted
and sat down under the shadow of a square
tower known as the Ladies’ Tower and built
on a knoll. A narrow fissure divides it from
the Monastery of Mar Saba into which no
woman is allowed to enter.</p>

<p>We were tired and hungry, but Ameen
soon unstrapped the luncheon baskets and
spread out on the rock the hard-boiled eggs,
the sardines and other dainties for our meal.
We fell to with much spirit, while Ameen
and Mustapha went to the convent to boil
water and make us refreshing tea.</p>

<p>Our first visitor was a yellow dog, thin and
mangy, who snapped up hungrily the morsels
of food we threw to him. Then a dozen or
so dark heads belonging to young girls and
boys popped up above the edge of the rock;
these were followed by a couple of wild-looking
men, from the Bedawîn encampment below.
They all stared solemnly at us and smiled at
our manner of eating, but they did not beg.</p>

<p>Presently a couple of Arab youths, smartly
dressed (for they were servants to a party of
travellers who were camping close by), made
their appearance, and, perching themselves on
a crag, gathered the ragged Bedawîn together,
and held forth with great animation, the
audience listening with open mouths.</p>

<p>Miss B. amused us by translating the
address which excited so much interest. <em>We</em>
were the subject of it.</p>

<p>“The Frangi ladies,” the Arab youth said,
“are like men. They do things like men—they
ride, they gallop, they run! They eat
what they like. They go where they like—they
never ask their husbands! All the
Frangis are rich; they have flocks and goats
and camels. They can buy the whole world
if they like. They have seen the whole world,
and they can speak the Arabic!”</p>

<p>This was the climax, the topstone of the
pinnacle of virtues and accomplishments of
this marvellous race of beings. The Bedawîn
looked incredulous. Miss B. said a few words
to the youth in Arabic, when the whole
company raised a shout of delight exclaiming—</p>

<p>“See! Hark! She speaks our language
like the Holy Prophet! Praised be Allah!”</p>

<p>The Convent of Mar Saba is built on the
side of a precipice, four hundred feet high.
It clings to the cliff, while its walls are
supported by huge buttresses. It is brown,
like everything else in the district. Deep
silence surrounds it. There it stands, melancholy
and alone, without a tree or shrub in
sight. Every breeze is shut out by great
crags. The sigh of the wind is never heard.
Solitude and death seem to reign everywhere.
We heard that the wretched inmates—monks
exiled for crimes or small offences—become
as fossilised as their surroundings.</p>

<p>It was in 480 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> St. Saba and St.
Euthymius, following the general custom of
ascetics, established the first nucleus of the
present monastery.</p>

<p>There is a solitary palm growing high up
on the side of the building, said to have been
planted by the Saint, which sprang up bearing
dates without stones on the same day.</p>

<p>There is also a cavern in the rock (into which
we did not go) where the Saint lived with his
lion, which at first had occupied the whole of
the cave, but, finding the Saint refused to be
ejected, he gave up the contest and contented
himself with a cupboard three feet square,
where he slept.</p>

<p>One traveller says that “the monks may
scarcely read the valuable manuscripts in their
library, yet they hide them carefully from the
eyes of heretics. Within the walls they may
neither smoke nor eat meat, yet raw spirits
find their way past the porter, as we were
able to prove. A more hopeless, purposeless,
degraded life can scarcely be imagined than
that of such hermits.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth and I, accompanied by Mustapha,
descended into the Fire Valley, as the huge
gorge is called, by which the waters of
Jerusalem are carried down to the Dead Sea.
It was dry now, and as we looked up at the
stern frowning monastery and its solitary
palm tree with its bright green leaves, our
spirits were depressed, and we hastened on.</p>

<p>It was in that melancholy prison that St.
Bernard conjured up the vision of beauty and
happiness expressed in his hymn—</p>

<p>The monk St. Stephen, in the eighth

</div></div></div>

<p>The remainder of our party met us at an
appointed spot, and almost in silence we rode
home through the Kedron Gorge, arriving in
Jerusalem just as darkness fell.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">he</span> message sent
to Sir John
Moore was
that Lord Castlereagh,
Secretary
of State,
desired to see
him on the
next day at 3
<span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, and that
he would be required
to leave
town quickly
afterwards.
This was all,
no hint of
further particulars being given.</p>

<p>Prompt as ever, Moore made his
arrangements, and ordered that a chaise
should be in waiting one hour later to carry him—anywhere.</p>

<p>At three he appeared before Castlereagh,
and was enlightened as to those
arrangements which, a day or two
later, Jack Keene indignantly related
to the Bryce circle.</p>

<p>Sir John, with all his sweetness of
disposition, had a fiery temper. And
though he habitually held in that temper
with so firm a curb that he could be
described as “the most amiable man
in the British Army,” yet there were
times when it got the better of him.
Those hazel eyes could flash with a
scathing light, and those lips could
pour forth vehement utterances. He
was not to be lightly roused; but perhaps
that which he could least patiently
endure was the sense of being unjustly
treated.</p>

<p>It may well be, too, that at this
moment he was physically suffering from
the severe strain of those most trying
expeditions to Sicily and Sweden. He
may have been still under something
of reaction from that hard fight in the
south of Italy, when his own “feelings”
had had to be sternly repressed, for the
sake of the young girl whom he loved.
In a short letter written three or four
days later from Portsmouth to his
mother, a note of weariness may be
detected, unwonted in Moore. But
Rest lay ahead—not far off—though a
fierce experience lay between.</p>

<p>One way or another, he did wax wrathful
in this interview with Castlereagh;
and his answer came promptly—</p>

<p>“My lord, a post-chaise is at my
door, and upon leaving this I shall
proceed to Portsmouth to join the
troops. It may perhaps be my lot never
to see your lordship again. I therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">{446}</a></span>
think it right to express to you my feelings
of the unhandsome treatment I have
received.”</p>

<p>“I am not sensible of what treatment
you allude to,” interrupted the Secretary.</p>

<p>Sir John had no difficulty in explaining
what he meant. Had he been an
Ensign, he said, he could hardly have
been treated with less ceremony. He
had not even been told, till the last
moment, how he was to be employed.
Coming as he did from a chief command,
if he were now to be placed in an inferior
post, some explanation certainly was his
due. Lord Castlereagh had told him
that his conduct in the Swedish affair
was approved of, but this did not look
like approval.</p>

<p>“His Majesty’s Ministers have a right
to employ what officers they please,”
Sir John went on, working off his
warmth. “And had they on this
occasion given the command to the
youngest general in the Army, I should
neither have felt nor expressed that the
least injury was done to me. But I have
a right, in common with all officers who
have served zealously, to expect to be
treated with attention, and when employment
is offered, that some regard should
be paid to my former services.”</p>

<p>“I am not aware, Sir John, of having
given you just cause for complaint,”
Castlereagh replied gravely; and he
made few further remarks. Who would
have imagined, looking on, that this
cold-mannered Secretary would, not
many months later, fight a duel in
defence of the fair fame of the gallant
General now before him?<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Moore had said his say, and no doubt
felt relieved. Without delay he started
post-haste for Portsmouth, pausing on
the road for one night at his mother’s
country home. Though he told her and
his sister of the apparent slight which
had been put upon him, as indeed he
could not avoid doing, since all the
world would know of it, he does not
seem to have been depressed, but talked
cheerily, and kept up their spirits all
the evening.</p>

<p>The parting next day was, however,
sadder than usual. Did any of them
guess it to be the last? Some forebodings
may well have suggested themselves
to the mother’s heart, as she
watched that manly figure pass away
into the distance. He had been to her
the most tender of sons; but on earth
she would see him never again.</p>

<p>From Portsmouth he wrote to her—</p>

<p>“The treatment I have received gives
me no longer uneasiness. The actions
of others I am not responsible for; it is
only my own, if they are unworthy, that
can mortify me. I am going on the
service of my country, and shall hope
to acquit myself as becomes me of whatever
part is allotted to me. God bless
you, my dear mother! I shall write to
you whilst I continue here, and hope for
the time when I shall be allowed to pass
the rest of my days quietly with you,
my brothers, and Jane.”</p>

<p>Four or five days later, while still in
Portsmouth, where he had pushed forward
preparations, he resigned to Sir
Harry Burrard the chief command of
those troops which for so long had been
in his own hands. He then wrote again
to his mother—</p>

<p>“One word I have to say and no
more. I have letters from London; all
has been communicated to the King and
the Duke of York, who have both
approved of all I have said and done....
All is now ready the moment the wind is
easterly. You may write when you
think fit, as I shall leave directions
about my letters.”</p>

<p>This was not the end of the matter.
But before telling the rest, a few words
about Roy are needful.</p>


<p class="p2">For Roy was entering on his first
campaign.</p>

<p>He was full of delight at the prospect.
During months past a passionate craving
to be sent against the enemy had pervaded
the English Army, and Roy was
behind no one in this desire. Alike by
inheritance and by early training, his
instincts were all soldierly; and that
was an age to call forth patriotism in
the dullest nature. But Roy was by no
means dull.</p>

<p>To be ordered, when barely eighteen,
to the seat of war—to serve under Moore
himself—this indeed was a fulfilment of
Roy’s utmost longings.</p>

<p>“You’ll write to me sometimes, won’t
you?” pleaded Molly, clinging tearfully
to him, when he came to say good-bye.
“And don’t be taken prisoner
again.”</p>

<p>“Trust me for that!” laughed Roy.
“I’ve had a taste already of French
prisons. Take care of yourself, Molly;
and don’t let Polly lose heart.”</p>

<p>“See, Roy, I have made this little
case for you. It has paper and pen
and pencil in it, and a tiny ink-bottle.
And you can put it into such a little
corner, or into your pocket. I want you
to keep a journal of all that happens—ever
so few words at a time. And perhaps
you might send me a sheet now
and then, when it is full.”</p>

<p>“All right. I don’t mind if I do.
Not a bad notion, on the whole. You’re
a good little sister. No man ever had
a better.”</p>

<p>Roy arrived at Portsmouth while Sir
John Moore was still there, and before
he had given over the command to
Burrard. It was always his way to see,
and personally to influence, the young
officers placed under his command, and
though he was not to be at the head of
affairs, he would still have control of
his own Division. Moore did not leave
nearly so much to unassisted Nature as
a good many generals of the day were
content to do. Roy, being aware of
this, was not astonished to be early
summoned to his presence, and punctually
at the hour named he reached Sir
John’s lodgings.</p>

<p>Others were there when he entered,
but Roy saw little clearly besides this
princely soldier, with whose fame for
many a long year all Britain had been
ringing, whose name on Ivor’s lips had
been from Roy’s infancy the very
embodiment of all that was noble and
true.</p>

<p>Sir John stood at the upper end of the
room, talking with his friend Colonel
Anderson—a strangely attractive figure,
alike dignified and winning, with a brow
of regal breadth and power, searching
luminous eyes, through which at times
the whole spirit of the man seemed to
shine, and well-cut sensitive lips, gentle
in expression as any woman’s, while yet
they could close like adamant. The
young Ensign’s heartbeat tumultuously,
under a rush of new sensations, and a
fervour of devotion for such a leader as
this sprang at once into being. In
that moment Roy knew why Denham
Ivor so loved Sir John, and why men
could with very gladness die for him.
Moore, gazing in his earnest fashion
upon the boy, smiled at the look he saw.
It was no new thing for him to be
conscious of his own almost magical
control over the hearts of others.</p>

<p>A few business-like questions were
put, as to when Roy had joined his
regiment, and the training he had since
received. Presently Moore remarked—</p>

<p>“So you escaped from Bitche, I am
told?”</p>

<p>“I was so fortunate, sir. With the
help of a Frenchman.”</p>

<p>“Ha! How was that?”</p>

<p>“He was grateful, sir, to my father
and wished to make a return. He had
been taken in the Conscription some
time before, and my father and Captain
Ivor helped to pay for a substitute. It
was for his old mother’s sake.”</p>

<p>This was a note which could not fail
to appeal to the most loyal of sons, and
Moore’s face showed quick response,
though he only said, “Détenus?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We were detained in
1803—my father and Captain Ivor. My
mother stayed with them, and I could
not get a passport. And later I was
sent to Bitche.”</p>

<p>“Not Denham Ivor of the Guards!
I remember—he was among the
détenus.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He was under you in the
West Indies and in Egypt.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I know him well. How
came he to linger so long in France?”</p>

<p>Roy explained briefly the small-pox
complication, the General listening with
still that intent gaze.</p>

<p>“Then Ivor is at Verdun still. Hard
upon him! As gallant a young fellow
as I ever had to do with. I would
give something to have him with me
now.”</p>

<p>Roy treasured up the words for Ivor’s
future comfort.</p>

<p>“Ivor feels it terribly, sir!” he said.</p>

<p>“You have been much thrown with
him!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He has been the best
friend to me that I ever could have.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it. He is a
friend worth having.” After a slight
pause, the General remarked, “Napoleon
made a blunder there for once.
The absence of proper exchange falls at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">{447}</a></span>
least as heavily upon the French as
upon ourselves. By-the-by, you know
Captain Keene also. He spoke to me
of you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We are connected.”</p>

<p>“Well, Baron, I shall expect a good
deal from a friend of Ivor!”</p>

<p>“I will do my best, sir,” Roy
answered. Then an interruption came,
and Sir John smiled kindly again, as he
turned away. Roy went out of the
room, captivated, dazzled, wild to do or
to dare aught in the world for the sake
of Moore.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>


<p class="p2">The last letter written by Sir John to
his mother from Portsmouth was dated
in the end of July, and he reached the
coast of Portugal on the 20th of August,
or about three weeks after the arrival
there of Wellesley. Moore was ordered
to disembark the troops with him, and
at once to join Wellesley’s force.</p>

<p>Three days before Moore could get to
the spot, Sir Arthur Wellesley—future
Duke of Wellington—gained a decisive
victory over the French at Vimeira.
Unfortunately he, like Sir John Moore,
was at this moment superseded in
command by Sir Harry Burrard, who
arrived while the battle was being
fought; and the pursuit of the flying foe,
which should have ended in a complete
rout, was timidly cut short. Next day
Sir Harry Burrard was in his turn superseded
by Sir Hew Dalrymple, whose
management of affairs and hasty signing
of an armistice raised at home a storm
of indignation.</p>

<p>“It is a pity,” wrote Moore in his
private journal with reference to Wellesley,
“that when so much had been
thrown into his hands, he had not been
allowed to complete the work.” And to
Sir Hew Dalrymple he spoke decidedly:
“If hostilities recommence, Sir Arthur
Wellesley has already done so much
that I think it but fair he should have
the command of whatever is brilliant in
the finishing. I waive all pretensions
as senior, for I consider this as his
expedition. He ought to have the
command of whatever is detached.”</p>

<p>But while Moore thus generously proposed
to sacrifice his own claims on
behalf of Wellesley, Sir Arthur was no
less anxious that Moore’s great gifts
should not be lost to his country. The
conduct of these two grand men, each
to the other, is a fair sight, beside the
jealousies which sometimes blemish the
bravest characters.</p>

<p>On the 17th of September Wellesley
sent a frank soldierly letter to Moore,
referring to the interview of the latter
with “His Majesty’s Ministers,” and
expressing a fear lest Moore’s action
might stand in the way of his being
raised to the supreme command. Would
Sir John Moore be willing to discuss the
question with him? “It appears to
me,” he wrote, “to be quite impossible
we can go on as we are now constituted.
The Commander-in-Chief must be
changed; and the Country and the
Army naturally turn their eyes to you as
their Commander.”</p>

<p>This disinterested letter took Moore
by surprise. The two had of course
met before, perhaps several times; but
they had not been intimate, though each
had appreciated the other. He at once
replied cordially, and the next day the
interview took place, Wellesley calling
upon Moore on his way home.</p>

<p>The confidential talk which followed
was a remarkable one. Two of the
greatest men of their age met, each
bent upon the good of his country—each
willing to sacrifice for the good of
the other what might be advantageous
for himself. One by birth was Irish,
one by birth was Scotch, but both were
British—nay, English!—to the backbone.
Sir Arthur Wellesley, in age
only eight years the younger, was still
at the opening of his grand career; Sir
John Moore, after thirty years of hard
service, was fast nearing the close of
his. Sir John’s at this date was a worldwide
fame. Sir Arthur, though he had
made his mark by a successful campaign
in India, was still not very famous
beyond a certain circle. But Moore
had noted his power.</p>

<p>They went into the matter calmly
together—Wellesley’s strongly-outlined
eagle face and large Roman nose
contrasting with the refined beauty of
Moore’s features. In force of character,
however, in strength of will, in courage
and patriotism, in freedom from all
narrowness of party spirit, the two were
alike. “Although I hold a high office
under Government I am no party man,”
Wellesley had declared in that memorable
letter to Moore, received only the
day before. With Wellesley, as with
Moore, private interests went down
before National interests, and Duty
was a word utterly supreme through
life.</p>

<p>Perhaps the main difference between
the two lay in the fact that Wellesley
lacked that peculiar “strain of sweetness,”
that element of womanly tenderness,
which made Moore to be so
intensely beloved. His was a more
homogeneously iron nature; but it was
of finely-wrought iron.</p>

<p>The meeting between Lord Castlereagh
and Moore, with Moore’s impetuous
self-defence, was referred to. Sir John
Moore gave full particulars of what had
passed, adding frankly:</p>

<p>“I thought it needful to express what
I felt under the circumstances. But,
having done so, I have felt no more
upon the subject.”</p>

<p>Wellesley demurred as to any such
need. He feared much that, unless
some explanation took place, Sir John’s
heat on that occasion might stand in
the road of his future usefulness to
England. He was perfectly sure that
there had been no unkind intentions on
the part of the Ministers, since he had
often heard them speak with high esteem
of Moore. Lord Castlereagh was naturally
of a “cautious” temperament, and
there might have been some difficultly in
giving the chief command to Sir John,
until a formal explanation had taken
place with the Swedish Court. Then
Sir Arthur asked—might he be authorised
to say to the Ministers that Sir John
was sorry to have been under a misunderstanding,
if indeed no slight had
been meant by them; and that, having
once for all spoken out what he felt, he
had now forgotten the matter, and would
think no more about it?</p>

<p>Moore could not at once agree to this
proposal. “Not a word has reached
me since I left England,” he observed,
“from anybody connected with the
Government. No opening having been
made on their side, I hardly see how I
can properly myself take the initiative.
Of course, when I spoke to Lord Castlereagh
as I did, I was quite aware of
what the consequences might be. But
to make a submission now, merely with
a view to obtaining a higher post—that
is out of the question!”</p>

<p>Sir Arthur was not convinced. His
one thought, then as ever, was for
England’s good. He knew what the
loss of Moore’s services in any degree
could not fail to be to England. It
seemed to him that personal feelings,
and what might be thought of any
personal action, were entirely unimportant
compared with the one great
question of the Country’s need, and the
one fact that Moore, beyond all other
living men, could supply that need. He
still earnestly urged his own view of
what ought to be done.</p>

<p>Presently, in response to further
arguments, Sir John partly yielded.
He remarked that, if Sir Arthur were
enough interested in the affair to care
to mention this conversation to Lord
Castlereagh, simply stating as a fact
known to himself that Sir John had not
the smallest feeling of ill-will to any
man in the Ministry, he was welcome to
do so.</p>

<p>“I spoke out my mind plainly,”
repeated Moore, “and there, so far as
I am concerned, the matter ended. But
naturally, if any wrong impressions are
held which might prevent my being
made use of, I should wish to have such
impressions removed. I should be
grateful to any friend who would kindly
set things right.”</p>

<p>Further than this Moore refused to
budge; and Wellesley, though absolutely
convinced that no slight whatever had
been meant, had to promise that he
would keep strictly to the terms dictated
by Moore. He sailed next day for
England.</p>

<p>But before he could carry out his
generous intentions, such action as he
most wished for had already been taken.
Dalrymple was recalled; Burrard was
superseded: and Moore was appointed
to the supreme command of twenty
thousand men, to be used in the North
of Spain, conjointly with the Spanish
armies, to drive the French backward.
Ten thousand men in addition were to
be at once sent out to him. Had the
Duke of York been allowed a free hand,
Moore might have had the command of
sixty thousand.</p>

<p>The news of his appointment was
received by Sir John quietly, with no
sign of exultation; and he at once bent
all his energies to the difficult task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">{448}</a></span>
before him. It was a task far more
difficult than anyone in England
imagined. The Spaniards were to prove
themselves utterly worthless as allies.
Money for expenses was eked out in the
reluctant style which in those days
still characterised the British Government
in all matters of warfare, no matter
which party might be in power. Moore’s
force consisted partly of raw recruits,
and largely of officers who had never
before seen active service. He had a
march ahead of between five and six
hundred miles, with every possible hindrance
in the complete lack of any
organised transport, and in the shape
of stormy wintry weather. Yet within
three weeks of his being placed in command,
the headquarters of the Army
removed from Lisbon!</p>

<p>He had been so strongly impressed
during the interview described, with the
lofty and disinterested character of the
future Iron Duke, that it must have
given him pleasure to receive from
Wellesley a letter, relating what he had
said to Castlereagh, as well as that
nobleman’s hearty reply about Moore,
and adding:</p>

<p>“I find that by the distribution I am
placed under your command, than
which nothing can be more satisfactory
to me!<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I will go to Coruña immediately,
where I hope to find you.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately Sir Arthur was kept in
England for the military inquiry into
late doings under Dalrymple; and
Moore had not the help of his presence
during the coming campaign.</p>

<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Percy.</span>—You could do no harm by putting a few
drops of tincture of benzoin into the water in which
you wash your face, but we much doubt whether it
would do any good. You must attend to your
digestion and always wear a veil when you go out.
A little glycerine and rose water applied to the face
may relieve the burning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Enid.</span>—Individuals differ greatly in the amount that
they perspire. Some persons seem scarcely to
perspire at all, while others get wet through from
any trifling exertion. As a rule fat persons perspire
more than thinner ones, and in them it is salutary,
as it reduces their fat. Excessive sweating is often
hereditary, as, indeed, it seems to be in your case.
You may not attempt to check perspiration too
much, for the sweat is an excretion by the skin
from the blood—it is one of the methods by which
the blood gets rid of its impurities. The best
known, and one of the most satisfactory preparations
for limiting the perspiration from the face and hands,
is toilet vinegar. Persons who perspire profusely
should wear woollen undergarments and change
them frequently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giddy Girl.</span>—Giddiness or vertigo is a symptom met
with in very many complaints. In biliousness,
acute indigestion and occasionally in chronic indigestion,
giddiness is not uncommon. In certain
diseases of the ears giddiness is usually present in a
very aggravated form. It occasionally occurs from
wax in the ears, and is not at all uncommon while
the ears are being syringed. Then there is the
vertigo associated with errors of sight—a common,
but often overlooked variety. And there is the true
brain vertigo—a common symptom of disease of the
nervous system. In anæmia, and one or two
diseases of the heart, giddiness is common—due to
the brain not being sufficiently supplied with blood.
Here you have the cause of vertigo in a nutshell.
To tell which of them is causing your giddiness,
with nothing whatever to guide us to a conclusion,
is quite impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Foolish.</span>—The pseudonym you have chosen is very
appropriate. You are exceedingly foolish to take
drugs of which you know nothing; but it is worse
than foolish, it is criminal. You look with horror
upon a man who is a chronic drunkard. You consider
it is a very great crime to drink more alcohol
than is necessary; is it not an equally serious crime
to take more drugs than are necessary? You
object to this because alcohol deprives you of
reason, whereas the drug you take does not. But
you are wrong; the drug you are taking does interfere
with the mind. It is worse than alcohol in
many ways. To take a drug which is unnecessary
is wrong; but the drug you take, cocaine, is one of
the most fatal of all to take habitually. You are
killing yourself by it. All persons who acquire the
cocaine habit die from it, unless they stop their
pernicious habit very soon. If you wish to save
your life you must abandon your habit without delay.
As we said before, to take cocaine is worse than to
get drunk—it is more injurious to the body, more
fatal to the mind, and more destructive to morality.
But where did you get the cocaine? Chemists are
forbidden to give poisons to silly girls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aged 50.</span>—At your time of life club-foot cannot be
cured by operation or otherwise. If the foot is
more trouble than good, you can have it removed;
there is nothing else that can be done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maid of Astolat.</span>—Yes; by all means continue with
the treatment. It often takes a long time to
completely eradicate acne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curious.</span>—It is an old superstition that you can cure
warts by rubbing them with a potato, and then
giving the potato to a pig to eat. Like most
similar superstitions it does not bear investigation.</p></div>


<h3>STUDY AND STUDIO.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Jo March.</span>”—1. Your fairy story is bright and
pretty. You use the word “and” too often, and
the closing scene about the giants and fairies
reads as though it were hurried, in comparison
with the rest of the little sketch. Were the flowers
for the ladder unfading?—2. We think you might
possibly succeed with fairy stories if you practised
composition. What you have sent us is scarcely
enough to show decided talent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecilia</span>—1. You ought to be guided by your teacher
as to the number of hours you should practise daily.
It is said that Paganini, when asked how long it
would take to learn the violin, replied, “Twelve
hours a day for twenty years.” On the other hand,
we have heard on very illustrious authority that
three hours taken in separate periods of practice is
enough for anyone. One thing you may receive as
certain—that when you get jaded and listless, practising
ceases to be of use. So long as you can
keep your attention alive and alert, practising will
do you good. Let us urge you to persevere and be
diligent. “The gods give nothing without labour
unto mankind” is an old Greek saying, and though
you may not always “like” practising, you will
reap the reward in years to come if you apply yourself
strenuously now.—2. For learning music by
heart, your second suggestion is the best—to study
it quite accurately, little by little. You may occasionally
of course try to give a general reproduction
of a piece, but that method alone would not make
you play really well from memory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Walker</span>, Litlington Rectory, Berwick, Sussex,
kindly sends us the rules of various improvement
societies, and offers to give information about them
to any of our girl readers. They are the following:—Early
Rising Society, Reading Society, Musical
Society, Walking Society, Language Society, Plain
Work Society, Knitting and Fancy Work Society.
Surely the readers who consult us about societies
will find something here to suit every need. We
advise them to apply to the Hon. Secretary, Mrs.
Walker, enclosing a stamped envelope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sympathetic.</span>—The real name of “Claribel” was
Charlotte Alington Barnard. She was born in
1830, and married in 1854. Her master was Mr. W.
H. Holmes. She published a hundred ballads
which have won extraordinary popularity. She
died at Dover in 1869. This is all we know of her
history. Possibly the sadder tone (to which you
refer) of her later ballads may have been due to
failing strength and health, as her death occurred
quite in the prime of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Historian.</span>—We find it difficult to answer your question
about the Czar and the succession to the
Russian throne without seeing the paragraph to
which you refer, but certainly there is no Salic law
in Russia. We cannot trace the letter you sent us
six months ago. Questions can never be answered
immediately, as we go to press long before you
receive your magazine, but we endeavour to reply
as quickly as possible.</p></div>


<h3>INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Florence</span>” has four would-be correspondents—(Miss)
E. Randall, Hopeville, The Greenway, Uxbridge,
Middlesex; H. Hughes, Downfield, Stroud,
Gloucestershire; Amy Day, 70, Broomfield Street,
Crisp Street, Poplar; and Mabel Brown, 24, Brigden
Street, Brighton. If “Florence” would allow
us to print her address here, it would expedite
matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Elsie Highton</span>, Brigham, Keswick, Cumberland,
would like to correspond with Miss Marguerite
Rahier, or with another French lady.</p></div>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Carillon.</span>—We think we have answered your question
before about carron oil, but as it may be out
of print, we are glad to do so again. Carron oil
is equal parts of olive oil and lime water well
shaken together, and is employed as a remedy for
burns. Some doctors add a very little laudanum
to it. It was first employed at the Carron Ironworks,
near Falkirk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Enona.</span>—1. A cartoon is a design drawn on strong
paper in chalks or distemper, to be afterwards
calked through, and transferred to the fresh plaster
of a wall to be painted in fresco oil-colour or
tapestry. The finest cartoons known are those
executed by Raphael for Leo X. in 1515 and 1516 as
patterns for tapestry. Each of them is about
twelve feet high, is drawn with chalk on strong
paper, and coloured in distemper by that master
and his pupils. They were ten in number, but
three have been lost. The seven you have seen at
the South Kensington Museum were bought in
Flanders by Rubens for our King Charles I., and
we owe their preservation to Cromwell, who bought
them from the King’s private collection for the
country. They are thought to be the finest of
Raphael’s works.—2. A cartouche is a different
thing entirely, and you have mixed up the two
perhaps from seeing both in the museums in
London, where you have seen the latter applied to
an elliptical oval on the ancient Egyptian monuments,
and in papyri also, on which are hieroglyphic
characters expressing the names and titles
of Egyptian kings. In architecture a cartouche is
a tablet for ornament or for an inscription, formed
like a sheet of paper with its edges rolled up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span>—If you be interested in the history and
use of bells, you had better read North’s <cite>English
Bells and Bell Lore</cite>, re-edited by the Rev. W.
Beresford. The ancient “mote bell” was rung to
assemble the people in cases of danger, or for
public purposes, by command of Edward the
Confessor. The “dole meadow bell” used to
summon the parishioners to vestry meetings. The
“storm bell” was appointed to “cause the fiends
and wicked spirytes to cease of the movyng of the
tempeste,” to which Bishop Latimer (martyr) made
allusion in one of his sermons (published by the
Parker Society). There was also the “common
bell” and the “pancake bell” used at Shrovetide
to summon people to confession. Besides these
uses, certain bells were employed for the use of
farming—calling the country-folk to seed-sowing,
harvesting, and gleaning, and which were rung also
on “Plough Monday.” The custom of ringing
“joy bells” at coronations, royal birthdays, and
weddings, is familiar to all, as well as the “passing
bell” to announce a death, the tolling at funerals
and executions, and the terror-inspiring “fire bell.”
We cannot tell you more in our correspondence
columns. Read the exhaustive work we have
named on bell lore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eugenie.</span>—The second Monday in July, 1940, will be
the 8th. Wrinkles in the forehead are caused by
raising the eyebrows, which draws the skin into
lines and rolls. The only way to cure them is by
leaving off making that special grimace, which
makes you look not only both old and plain, but
gives a silly and an unhappy expression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Firenze.</span>—<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Catafalco</i> is an Italian word, meaning “a
scaffold” or funeral canopy, and is applied to a
temporary piece of woodwork decorated with painting
and sculptures, representing a tomb, and employed
in funeral solemnities. We have the word
in French also, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">catafalque</i>, which dates from the
fifteenth or sixteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy.</span>—Jan. 13th, 1866, was a Saturday; Feb. 17th,
1864, was a Wednesday.</p></div>

<div class="footnotes"><p class="ph3">FOOTNOTES:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The famous duel between Castlereagh and
Canning—those, unhappily, were still the days of
duels in England—was supposed to have taken place
because Canning had ousted Castlereagh from office.
But on the authority of Lady Castlereagh, Sir W.
Napier offered a different explanation. This was,
that her husband might have been reinstated in office
if only he would have agreed to “sacrifice the reputation
of Sir John Moore.” Such a proposal was, as
the stern old historian writes, “an insult well
answered with a shot.”—<cite>Life of Sir Charles Napier</cite>,
by Sir W. Napier.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The Marquis of Londonderry, one of Moore’s
later critics, wrote: “Perhaps the English army has
produced some abler men than Sir John Moore; it
has certainly produced many who, in point of military
talent, were and are quite his equals; but it cannot,
and perhaps never could, boast of one more beloved,
not by his own personal friends alone, but by every
individual that served under him.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This is the more remarkable an expression
because, after the appointment of Sir Hew Dalrymple
over his head in the end of August, Wellesley
had written privately to Lord Castlereagh, expressing
an earnest wish to leave Spain, for “I have been too
successful with this army ever to serve with it in a
subordinate situation with satisfaction to the person
who shall command it, and, of course, not to myself.”
To serve under Sir John Moore with that same army
was plainly in his eyes a very different matter.</p></div></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
